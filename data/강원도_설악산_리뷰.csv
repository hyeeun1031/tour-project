"Beautiful national park Most visitors will take a cable car up to Gwongeumseong Peak.  You will need  to pick a time slot to take the cable car for your ascent but there is no need to take a specific time slot for the descent. You get lovely views on the way up and around the short hike up the peak. It will be good to check the weather and make sure it is not too cloudy to ensure you get the best views. At the base of the cable station, there are short walks which brings you to Sinheungsa temple and the big sitting Buddha. There are also various hikes of varying degrees of difficulty but we did not have time for those. The visit to Gwongeumseong Peak and Sinheungsa temple will already take 2-3 hours so set aside a full day if you want to do the hikes. It will be preferable to stay overnight in nearby Sokcho (30 mins drive) or the hotels at Seoraksan itself if you want to do the hikes."
New visitor center with walk among the treetops.
"Very nice national park with forests, beautiful walks and beautiful nature. What makes an extra impression is the care taken with the facilities. There is a walk on a bridge through the treetops which is very solid and well executed. The visitor center was just open and showed the nature, but also the eventful history of this part of Korea, which was once part of North Korea. No expense has really been spared here to make up for a visit. Even if you don't walk very easily great park for walking around Famous national park in Korea - several different trails ... we just did the cable car and Buddhist temple. Next time I'd like to hike to the waterfalls. Parking was $6K won. Cable car up the mountain was $15K won - not as many views as I would've liked at the top but it was still very nice; they have a cafe too; cable cars run very frequently up/down.  I actually enjoyed walking around the Buddhist temple more - so peaceful, and also one of the biggest temples in South Korea. Just before reaching the temple, they had black clay tablets where you could write personal tributes ... for a fee. The gift shops were just ok ... not the greatest selection."
A must see park Excellent place if you like to hike beautiful paths. There are easy hikes to the temple and mountain (by cable car) and more challenging hikes - some are for experienced hikers.
"great views Had a 2-hour hike up to the top and loved it.  The views of the river and mountains as you hike is awesome. It was a bit cold, but you warmed up quickly.  The first 20 minutes is easy on pavement, then the trail goes to gravel and then very steep rocks and wooden steps.  We got there just at the end of the cherry tree blossem- and it was still nice. The temple is worth a visit.  A few signs are in English, but it was nice to have a guide."
Take long time for better life.
"It was very cold. I visited first time to take 3 hours, It worthwhile.I met Japanese tourist in market.He said, Seoraksan Mountain was the best view in my life.I agree bro."
"Visit the autumn foliage Luckily, you suddenly saw the leaves change before the rain, and it's all over. By morning, there's no problem parking. Go to the bathroom first, because it's cold, but inside the temple there's a bathroom, a bit far, people come and hiking a lot. The size of the morning, people in line up a lot of carts. Walk to take photos and buy candles to the Grand Place of the Temple at Sin-Hunsa. For the sake of elegance. Buy lovely postcards at the Information Center and Stamps of the park, with the day, stamps sent home."
"Northernmost National Park in Korea Snow Mountain National Park is a national park located in the northernmost part of South Korea. Snow Mountain is known as Snow Mountain, Snow Mountain, and because of the snow for many years, the rock is white like snow, so it is called Snow Mountain. The Shenyang Mountains crossing four counties such as Jiangsu Road, Lin Ching County, High City County, Shenyang County. The highest peak is 1708 meters above sea level. Snow Mountain is home to monstrous pines, trees of all kinds, large waterfalls, streams running in narrow valleys, mysterious ancient temples and pure air. In the autumn you can go to the Danfoss, in winter you can go to the snow white, and the beautiful views throughout the year. We are mostly on this route, although the weather is bad, but it is pretty."
"Sunyak Mountains It is the famous Sunyak mountain headbone. I know it's a spring, but it feels slightly less on the side of the dwarf water and the valley due to the weather."
"Beautiful nature park near Sokcho We were here in mid-October and the whole park turned in autumn colours. The higher you got, the orange/red/yellower it became. Further here three beautiful hikes done! One to Ulsanbawi rock, one to the Biryong Falls and the lookout point and one last to the Yangpok shelter. We were here for two days and that's more than enough. You can also take the cable car up, but according to the locals that had little added value if you were already going to do these hikes."

Loved this Place - Sokcho and Seoraksan was an exceeds expectations experience.
If you like hiking and National Parks go here.  Lots of choices for hikes or you can just explore the area around the main entrance and take a Gondola to an overlook.  I chose to take a cab from Sokcho and their are cabs waiting for your return.
I have never seen a mountain as magnificent as this one.
"Having seen it in a Korean drama, I had always wanted to visit and was much more astonished to see it in person. Even though there wasn't much foliage?”it must have been even more striking with all of the fall hues?”it's still quite beautiful. traveled to the Sinheungsa temple and took the cable car. Unending crowds, but there's little you can do about it?”this is a very well-liked location."
"A challenging climb in Seorakasan national park After a short bus ride to the entrance of the park started the walk of 5 kilometers the first part is via a built concrete path, we had to go through the forest for work but then the climb begins and that is not easy. At the end it is a steel staircase to the top with three different plateaus. The view is worth it. Back with knees buckling, that's what it felt like."
"Water, guide, driver and shoes We are 4 people so we took a Sunny Seoul company trip with guide Grace Kim and driver Mr. Kim.  Both of them took us from the hotel to an experiential day in a magical place.  The long drive was accompanied by important and in-depth explanations that prepared us for a trip to the park.  We had lunch with local food, went up the cable car to Mad Mountain and got an explanation about the lookout for the northern and southern readings.  Grace did not spare and patiently explained every question.  At the edge of the mountain we took spectacular photos.  Below the mountain we visited the Buddha temple and drank health tea.  The escort at the place is so important for understanding the park - don't give up!  Come with walking shoes and plenty of water.  It's worth the long trip and for us it would have been better in a car with guidance - highly recommended!!!"
Such beauty is breathtaking!
"This park is worth visiting for everyone! During the week there were few people, there were no queues for the funicular. There is a great view on the mountain! Such beauty takes your breath away. The park is very beautiful. The mountain is a must visit!"
"The most beautiful national park in South Korea Considered the most beautiful national park in Korea, Seoraksan (?œSnow Peak Mountain?? enchants hikers. With peaks towering above the clouds, waterfalls, rare birds and even the 7th century Sinheungsa Temple, from which paths lead to Mount Ulsan Bawi, Seoraksan National Park is as diverse as its landscapes. Climb the peaks, the highest of which, Daecheon-bong, is 1,708m high, or take the cable car up Mount Gwonggeum."
"Worth spending a whole week hiking there We took a taxi (around 15K-20K) from the Lotte. It?™s much faster than to take the bus and you will get the same traffic jam the last 2-4 kms. I was surprised by the crowd even in the middle of the week. I guess it?™s better to avoid the week-end and it should be even worse during school holidays. But I understand why it?™s so popular : the place is BEAUTIFUL and everything is organized to welcome the most people as possible.The first thing to do is to buy the cable car tickets (15K per person), as they sell really fast and you probably will have to wait an hour until your Â«Â boarding timeÂ Â». But it?™s worth the money and the wait. Up there you have to walk up on stairs and on an uneven path, so make sure to wear hiking shoes.We did another hike, to Biseondae rocks. It?™s an easy walk, but more comfortable with hiking shoes. It takes 1.5-2 hours back and forth. Be aware to take enough water, as outside the recreational area next to the entrance gate (where you have a lot of shops, coffee shops and restaurants), there is no place to buy a bottle of water.I would have liked to stay longer or to come back the next days. There are so many other hikes to do. I guess you can easily spend a whole week there. And with autumn leaves starting to turn red and yellow, it was truly beautiful and especially peaceful (most people tend to stay around the recreational area).I think Sokcho area is the place to stay if you feel exhausted by the bustling city life of Seoul : no shopping, just eating, waking and chilling."
"Great retreat into the mountains Amazing view from the top! We were not seasonal hikers, took us 3.5 hours on the way up and 2 hours back down. Bring walking sticks and wear knee guards! It was a great retreat into the mountains."
"Magical place A magnificent, magical, captivating parkLots of hiking possibilities and the colors of this early autumn are splendidA wide variety of cafes and restaurants on siteSpecial mention for the small souvenir shop right next to the Buddha Breathtaking mountain This is the most beautiful mountain I have ever seen. I always wanted to get here, seen it in korean drama and was very impressed,  but to see it first hand was amazing. The foliage was partial only, must be even more impressive with the full autumn colors, but it's still absolutely breathtaking. Took the cable car and visited Sinheungsa temple too. Crowds were endless but nothing you can do, this is highly popular destination. Grab a taxi to get there then walk the last portion, avoid the bus not to get squeezed like sardines."

"Beautiful natural park Beautiful natural park that is on the UNESCO world heritage list. Sokcho is the ideal base. Entrance is free. You can walk different routes. Self-chosen for Ulsanbawi Rock. A 'short' route but no less than 888 stairs up, so a tough climb. The higher we got, the more we came into the clouds (which hung very low). A little bit of drizzle. Lots of animals along the way, birds and squirrels. Once at the top, no view because of low hanging cloud/fog, so little to see, but still magical. Still more than worth it!"
"For everyone Park accessible by bus from Sokcho, at the entrance there is a restaurant area, beautiful temple to visit, several walking routes, waterfalls, funicularContrary to what is announced in the guides, we did not pay entry."
"Seoraksan or Mount Seorak (¼³¾Ç»ê) is part of the Taebaek mountain range in the Gangwon Province in eastern South Korea. Seoraksan has some 28 peaks, of which Daecheongbong Peak at 1,708 meters is the third highest mountain peak in South Korea and because this peak is covered with snow for five to six months in a year, the mountain is ascribed the name ""Seorak"" (meaning ""snowy peak""). Seoraksan National Park was designated as South Korea's fifth national park in 1970 and as South Korea's first UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in 1982. It is divided into the eastern section or outer section (Oeseorak), western section or inner section (Naeseorak) and the southern section (Namseorak).

Seoraksan National Park is definitely one of the most popular attractions in South Korea, especially in autumn. So on a sunny and clear weekday on the first week of November autumn, my family and I spent an enjoyable 5 and half hours at this national park.

Getting there, entrance fees & opening time
If you have a car, it would be a straightforward 12 km drive from Sokcho to Seoraksan National Park. Since my family did not rent a car, we took bus 7-1 at the bus stop opposite the Sokcho Express Bus Terminal (we can also take bus number 7). Both 7 and 7-1 buses run on 30-minute interval. The bus fare is \ 1300 to the ¡°Seoraksan Sogongwon¡± stop. The whole bus journey was about 30 minutes, including a 4-minute jam at the Park car park entrance. We reached the park at 9:30 am and thankfully it was not crowded as this was a weekday. On the return trip to Sokcho, we took the 7-1 bus from the designated bus stop in the car park at 3:20pm.
Seoraksan National Park¡¯s opening hours are 6am to 8pm daily while the cable cars operate from 9am to 6pm. Entrance fee is \4500 for adult (age 20 to 65), \2000 for youth (age 14 to 19) and \1000 for children (age 8 to 13). Cable car tickets cost \ 11000 for adult (middle school students or older) and \7000 for children (37 months to elementary school).

Attractions at Seoraksan National Park
After we walked past the entrance, we entered into Sogongwon Park (Sogongwon or ¼Ò°ø translated as ¡°small park¡±) where there is black bear statue on top of square structure bearing ¡°Seoraksan National Park¡± inscription. There are a few hiking trails to the attractions in the Park on a nearby huge board. Based on the map on the board, I think these are the main one-day hiking routes with the approximate one-way trek timing between attractions and the level of difficulty of hike (depends on your fitness and your duration for resting and taking photographs):
(1) Great Buddha of Reunification (easy, 5 minutes) - Shinheungsa Buddhist Temple (easy, 10 minutes) - Heundeulbawi or Heundeul Rock (moderate, 1.5 hour) - Ulsanbawi or Ulsan Rock (difficult, 0.5 hour). The hike to Ulsan Rock is ranked as the most popular at Seoraksan National Park due to the unique rock formation and the fabulous views from the Rock.
(2) The 3 Waterfalls Hike - Hike 1.9 km through the forest to Yukdampokcho or Yukdam Falls (easy, 40 minutes), a further 0.4 km strenuous uphill hike to Biryongpokcho or Biryong Falls (moderate, 20 minutes) and final 0.5 km muscle-aching and extremely arduous vertical stairs ascent to the Towangseong Falls Observatory (difficult, 30 minutes).
(3) Great Buddha of Reunification (easy, 5 minutes) - Biseondae (Rock) (easy, 1 hour, 2.5km flat trail walking alongside the stream) - Geumganggul Cave (difficult, 1 hour strenuous ascent)
(4) Gwongeumseong Fortress ? easy 15 hike to the 690-metre-high Fortress after alighting from cable car
(5) Leisure walk around Sogongwon Park with restaurants, mountain views and autumn foliage (in autumn).
For my family and I, we visited Gwongeumseong Fortress located at the top of Dolsan (Mount Dol) and after lunch hiked to Yukdam Falls.

The Attraction: Seoraksan National Park Cable Car
The moment my family and I entered Sogongwon Park, we quickly walked to the cable car station to buy our cable car tickets. Due to the popularity and the limited number of 50 passengers in the cable car, we had to choose the timing of the cable car ride when we bought the tickets ? do note that it¡¯s not a case of buying the tickets and then join the queue to take the next cable car. Hence I advise not to leave buying the cable car tickets to the last minute because you do not want to be in a situation where there are no more time slots available for the rest of the day. Also, the cable car, which leave every 5 minutes, will not operate in the event of strong winds. We booked the 10:05 am slot and walked around Sogongwon Park enjoying the autumn foliage to kill time.
The 6-minute cable car ride offered breathtaking views of the mountains, valley and the unmistakable white Ulsan Rock. At the top of the cable car station, there is a cafe selling drinks, snacks and Korean and Japanese cuisine. There is also a viewing deck with dining tables on the side of the building to enjoy the beautiful scenery of Sokcho, Ulsan Rock and the surrounding mountains.

The Attraction: Gwongeumseong Fortress
Upon exiting the cable car station at the top, we turned right and walked (¡°easy¡± level) about 15 minutes on a gradual ascending unpaved flat and then rocky path to the base of a brown rock 690-metre summit with a few Korean pine tress and two rocky peaks (smaller left and larger right) at the summit ? this is Gwongeumseong Fortress.
Certain sources have pointed to two men - Gwon and Kim - building a stone fortress or castle on this site to protect their families and the villages against the invading Mongolians during the Goryeo period in the thirteenth century. Some 800 years later, do not be disappointed today you cannot find any remnant of the fortress (except perhaps for piles of rocks and stones which served as resting or sitting area for some visitors). Nevertheless, like most visitors, we came for the panoramic views. Indeed, when we reached the Fortress, the mountain peaks across the Fortress greeted us with such majestic appearance and presence that we were simply awed! As we ascend to the summit and looking to our left, we saw the granite-composed Manmulsang Peak next to us and the towering mountain peaks of 1275bong, Nahanbong (1298 m), Sejonbong, Yuseondae, Janggunbong, Jeonhangnyeong and Hwangchulbong (1381 m) behind the Manmulsang Peak. I climbed to the summit and was rewarded with incredible 360-degree uninterrupted view of the outer or eastern section as well as inner or western section, Seoraksan mountain consisting of the aforementioned mountain peaks plus other peaks, forested mountain slopes, Cheongbuldong Valley, Ulsan Rock, Heundeul Rock, Sokcho city, East Sea, whole of Gwongeumseong Fortress and the autumn foliage on the mountains. What a magnificent and stunning sight to behold!
While we were there on a weekday late morning, there was not a crowd of visitors, so there was more than ample space for everyone to move around. However, do be careful of not going too near to the rock cliff edge.

We ate lunch (tonkatsu, black bean noodle) at the cable car upper station restaurant before taking the cable car down to the Sogongwon Park.

The Attraction: Yukdam Falls (Yukdampokpo)
After refreshing ice-creams at Caf? Sol, we were ready to hike to the 3 waterfalls in the following sequence ? Yukdam Falls, Biryong Falls and the Towangseong Falls Observatory (to see the Towangseong Falls across). Eventually due to time constraints, we could only do the Yukdam Falls, the first of the 3 waterfalls and the easiest one to reach. Biryong Falls require 400 metres of moderate ascent while the Towangseong Falls Observatory require a very difficult and strenuous 400 metre accent of about 900 staircase steps. There is no entrance fee to these 3 waterfalls.
To get to the 3 waterfalls, look for a road or path on the right after the Cable Car station or on the left after the Seoraksan Park entrance that leads to a signage post pointing the direction toward ¡°Biryong Falls 2.3km¡± and ¡°Towangseong Falls Observatory 2.8km¡±. We walked the pointed direction, enjoyed the autumn foliage along the way and soon we crossed a wide bridge over Ssangcheon River (the river is full of white boulders and rocks) and then turned left. After walking along the river for about 300 metres past the Kensington Hotel on the opposite bank of the river, the flat paved path then veered away from river and into a forest that is full of maple, oak and Korean red pine trees. The clear forest walking path led us to some restrooms (note that there were no more restrooms from here onwards) after an unnoticeable gradual ascent. At the restrooms, there is a signpost stating ¡°Yukdam Falls 0.4km¡±, ¡°Biryong Falls 0.8km¡± and ¡°Towangseong Falls Observatory 1.2km¡± and the walking path turned right. The noticeable ascent began. The wood log path became irregular rock path and later joined alongside a flowing stream, cascades and beautiful blue and green pools or ponds. Finally, after hiking for about 1.9km and about 1 hour, we arrived at the viewing deck with 3 benches of the Yukdam Falls (after crossing a small bridge).
In front of the viewing deck is the stunning view of the thin 40-metre high Yukdam Falls gushing into a pool and a suspension bridge across Yukdam Falls. We reached the suspension bridge via first crossing a wooden bridge next to the viewing deck and then climbing wooden stairs. The view from the suspension bridge was even more stunning and gorgeous of the Yukdam Falls, picturesque pool or pond with boulders, valley flanked by steep mountain slopes, 2 bridges and the autumn foliage. It was great that there were only a few visitors while we were there; most of these visitors were either moving on to or coming back from Biryong Falls, hence the suspension bridge was not vibrating. I anticipate there would be more visitors on weekends. After soaking in the refreshing and cooling ambience of Yukdam Falls for about 30 minutes, we hiked back to the Seoraksan National Park entrance.
Interestingly, it dawned upon me much later that the few coloured pools that we saw during our hike to and fro Yukdam Falls are part of this waterfall because Yukdam Falls ((À°´ãÆøÆ÷, ×¿ÓÁøîøÖ) translates to ¡°six pools waterfall¡± (and not ¡°six waterfalls¡±).

Overall, my family and I enjoyed the following at Seoraksan National Park¡¯s Gwongeumseong Fortress, Cable Car and Yukdam Falls:
(1) Being high up in the mountains and soaking in the cool refreshing air in a care-free manner, which is such a stark contrast to our hectic lives in crowded cities,
(2) The beautiful autumn foliage hues of red, yellow and orange on the mountains, in the forest and at Sogongwon Park (the base of Seoraksan). Every year, Seoraksan National Park is one of the first and most impressive places to see autumn foliage, peaking in mid-October.
(3) The views atop Gwongeumseong Fortress and at Yukdam Falls suspension bridge are truly stunning and breathtaking! It makes us appreciate the vastness and the beauty of Mother Nature.
(4) The Park¡¯s accessibility to hikers and non-hikers (such as families with children), the latter would appreciate the cable car as well as easy flat hiking routes.

So there you have it ? a ¡°3-in-1¡± (¡°3 attractions in 1 day¡±) trip to the Seoraksan National Park for my family and me. One day is not enough to visit all the attractions in this National Park, and I hope to return again one day. Nevertheless, there is so much natural beauty in the mountains, unusual rock formations, streams (rivers), waterfalls, valleys, flora and fauna, that it is no surprise that Seoraksan National Park is one of the Top 100 Must-Visit Tourist Spots in Korea for 2021-2022. This National Park is definitely a ¡°must do¡± when you visit South Korea in any season, not just autumn.

Before you go, do remember that as this attraction requires plenty of walking and climbing, I definitely recommend wearing a pair of sturdy yet comfortable walking shoes, bringing drinking water and more importantly walking at your own pace considering that the air becomes less and less as you ascend higher and higher up the mountains. It can get quite cold and sometimes windy up on the mountain (especially in autumn), so wear a sweater where necessary."
Nostalgia for the most beautiful place on earth.
"I lived in Sok'cho  Feb '66-Dec 67. I fell in love with the place and the people. Changed my life. Today I at 81 years I feel deep nostalgia for Sok'cho, Soraksan, the food and the sea. But mostly the people."
"Wonderful natural beauty in northern South Korea Even though the day was cloudy/drippy prior to the Typhoon coming, we had a wonderful trip in Seoraksan. Take the cable car to the top - well worth the experience!"
"Very commercialized place The view was good. Place is pretty crowded and sadly the people working at the ticket booth did not respect the price listed. They will just charge everyone as adult including kids and they refuse to acknowledge the kids. Be careful and ask for the change when you are not paying exact amount, they will pretend that they do not need to return you the change. Management of the place need to be improved. Come early as parking is limited."
Excellent national park Stunningly beautiful with well signed trails. Climb up Ulsanbawi  well worth the effort. Very tranquil feel and mid week not that busy.
"Breathtaking views, a must do My partner and I did this hike in winter. We took the No.7 bus from the stop about 100m down from Sokcho express bus terminal (1,700 WON each) and arrived at the entrance.It was absolutely a must to have brought our spikes for the hike, as in winter the ice is very slippy and can be dangerous.We reached the top in approximately 2 and a half hours, but my partner is not physically fit so this can definitely be done quicker. The route is moderate, so not too difficult but there are some some steep parts.The views on the way are breathtaking, and the trail itself is beautiful, particularly in the snow. Be careful at the top if it is windy, and the falls are steep!Overall, would absolutely recommend coming here and spending at least a night in Sokcho to do this hike."
Amazing Nature A really amazing Nationalpark for a great hike.The nature in autumn is really beautiful and the views you can get there are really amazing!Due the weekends it could be really crowded Absolutely beautiful!
"Such a beautiful and magnificent mountain with amazing tracking routes, beautiful temples and breathtaking streams. If you love nature and tracking, you will 100% love this place."

We picked the perfect time of year.
"SEP 2012 Very nice stay. My wife and I took our teenaged daughter and her best friend here for the weekend a couple of years ago and we loved it! We tried to do everything that was available at the location. The rooms are really nice and the food was also. We spent the whole weekend exploring and taking in the sights. It was a physically demanding to climb and walk so places but nothing that the average person couldn't do. Not sure if I would go in the middle of summer, we went in September and it was pretty warm still. I highly recommend taking a trip here Amazing Nature A gorgeous piece of nature that any outdoorsy traveler in Korea should experience! Great hikes, temples, cable car (if you wish). Go if you are in the area!"
"Seoraksan National Park is the best place to visit in Autumn in Korea I visited Seoraksan National Park on the last week of October and it was the peak of autumn foliage in the mountain. I think I came just at the perfect time when leaves are still intact in the trees and exist in different vibrant vivid autumn colors. I woke up very early in the morning (around 5 AM) and used a tour taxi to get to the Seoraksan. It is recommended to visit the park as early as possible since heavy traffic is always expected during this season. I also used the cable car to get up to the top of the mountain and to see stunning views of the mountain. Since mountain trekking is an all-time favorite hobby of most Korean people, Seoraksan was a bit crowded when I visited. During the pandemic, I think it is still safe to travel in Korea because people observe strict social distancing measures and everyone is wearing protective masks. If you are planning to visit Seoraksan, make sure to plan it well to see other beautiful tourist spots such as the Ulsan Bawi, Biryongpokpo Falls, Oryeonpokpo Falls, and Towangseongpokpo Falls Hiking A must visit for nature lovers, site seers, and hikers a like.  This place offers days of exploration for the occasional hiker to the most experienced Family of 7 spent a beautiful fall day here We had a lovely experience. We drove as far as we could to park, paid 5k won to park and 10k won entrance fee.  We got cable car tickets immediately (bought them at 9:05 and our time was 9:45).  We hiked out to the peak and got back down from the top about 11am. We ate lunch then hiked Biryong Falls. Our bigger kids made it all the way to the top but our littles stopped at the suspension bridge. We still saw some beautiful views!  We saw the statue and temple before heading back to our pension around 2pm. Masks, temperature checks required for everyone to do the cable car . (October 2020) Wonderful  Views!!"
"I recommend hiking with my family. Sometimes it was a little hard to walk, but the road is not rough. It is good to feel the beautiful nature. And the Buddha at the entrance is very grand. You can heal your mind with this peaceful atmosphere."
"Amazing national park Seoraksan is beautiful. It is located 11 km from Sokcho and seaside. It is very easy to access. In case of big affluence, it is recommended to park  at the kensington hotel. It is also important to book the cable car as soon as you arrive."
Awesome!
A very beautiful place to visit! You can take very pretty pictures almost anywhere. There are different hikes available but it may get pretty cold during winter time. The scenery gets better and better as you advance up the trails.
Beyond awesome!
"This National Park is absolutely, positively the most spectacular park I have ever been to.  It has a hike for everyone!   The Buddhist temples along the way just enhance the enjoyment of the whole experience!   I have been here in several occasions and have taken different hikes and never been disappointed."
Excellent visit! Must see..
"The views are breath taking, families with children can also visit comfortably. Good facilities and services. If he visit top of the mountain..the view is breath taking. Great hikes and lots of spots to take great memorable pictures and make great memories. Even can enjoy a small picnic by the streams."

"Really lovely for full day trip I initially planned to spend around half a day, but I think it's worth a full day trip to really walk all the way to the top and take it all in. All the good reviews are worth it - the landscape is stunning!"
"Beautiful Always enjoy a stroll or a hike in the mountains. Park is well maintained, and still only paid $30 for 3 admissions and 2 people return ticket on the cabal car. The cable car was a bit crowded but with trips every 5 min it's manageable. The views are breathtaking.A favourite place to visit!"
Wow!  Stunning views!
"Didn't know what to expect, but this park is really worth to visit. We stayed at the Kensington Hotel around the corner, which was perfect. The park offers some nice hikes (even long ones). Although my son was a bit stressed (especially because of the open stairs) and didn't reach the top we had a great time and really enjoyed the hike and the views!"
So beautiful and peaceful.
I went to Mount Seoraksan and it was a great time.  I was lucky to see the mountain under the snow.  it was sometimes a bit difficult to take the walking trails but if you have good equipment it is possible.  Everyone is very nice and smiling.  so I had a great time there and I recommend everyone to go whatever the season.
Nice views of nature and temples.
The place is well visited by both tourists and locals. Unfortunately the cable ride to the top is suspended due to high winds. We settled to walk around the park and towards the main temple. There is also a huge Buddha on the way. The bridges both old and new made of stone and wood are sight to see with the mountains as a background. A lot of good photo opportunity.
"seoraksan scenery in the beginning of winter seoraksan scenery in mid-december 2019, snow had started to fall the night before. so seoraksan look beautiful with a view of the effects of autumn and covered with snow. Where the temperature is not too extreme cold, it can be said that the temperature is very supportive for visitors to walk around the seoraksan."
"Short review on Mt Seorak Lovely place to visit. Breathtaking views and well worth the effort climbing up the steep, rocky trail after the cable car ride up."
"Mount seorak Mount seorak is the third highest mountain in South Korea, after Mount Halla on Jeju Island and Mount Jiri in South Gyeongsang. and that is a beautiful place, in there have a statue of bear which is one of the icons to take pictures You can use the cable car to get a closer look at the more beautiful scenery and you also have to be careful during the winter because it is very slippery Well maintained National Park The national park is the final alighting stop when you take bus 7 or 7-1 from Sokcho city. Admission fee was 3,500KRW. If you?™re keen for some hikes, the three waterfalls are a sight to catch. Do take note that there are quite a fair bit of upward stairs to take. For religious visit, there is a temple there with a huge Buddha statue. Don?™t just walk past it, cos there is a stairway at the back of the statue leading an underground mediation area. There is also another hiking trail that leads to the Bisendae and some caves further down, but that is about a 10km journey. It was a pity that the ulsanbawi trail was closed during this winter trip."
"Attractive scenery It was very windy when I visited Seoraksan  and the cable car stopped functioning. My friends and I hiked the Biryong trail to see the waterfall. The waterfall is stunning and worth the hike. The hike is not too long distance but relatively difficult for a beginner hiker like me. The Hallasan Yeongsil trail is easier than Biryong trail but much longer distant. Biryong trail has more stone paths, hanging bridge etc. Overall, I would revisit Seoraksan again for the beautiful scenery."

"Perfect for a stroll and nature viewing If you want to be in nature but don?™t want to hike, this park is perfect for you. You can take your family here for a nice stroll, but make sure you go on a sunny and warm day unless you want to freeze! I went when it was super cold (but hiked, so it was OK) so I took a warm jacket and it was alright, but I think it would?™ve been much better if I had gone in the springtime."
"Good views I did not join the hiking tour but took an easier one ie getting to the top in a cable car. The whole trip was much easier than originally thought. I had to wait only 40 minutes for the cable car (running every 5 minutes and carrying 50 persons; best to buy the cable car ticket as early as possible); took pictures of the Buddha statue and of the surrounding areas in the meantime, before going back to the cable car station. Then there was a walk of some minutes up to the fortress. The walk was not difficult and the stairs were lined with anti-slip rubber. At the top there were many people; all coming up for the expansive views. The whole trip took about 3 hours."
"Absolutely a must do Can easily spend days here doing all the various walks, bring water as some of the hikes are a little tough but are so worth it One of the most beautiful places in Korea Hailing from a lovely mountainous place myself, I take hikes and surrounding mountains very seriously while traveling. There?™s just something soul soothing about strolling along beautiful scenery, surrounded by nature. Seoraksan is massive, with the best views coming from the hikes themselves rather than just the cable car area shown in photos attached. There are food areas near Seoraksan cable car, and great snacks available this time of year such as Hotteok. It an absolute must see, photos cannot do it justice. Definitely look up more on the park before you go, you won?™t be disappointed."
"Hike+Autumn Leaves The easiest(??) and one of the popular route to seoraksan is to the Biryong waterfalls. We went here on a weekend, so it was like everyone from Seoul wanted to see Seoraksan. By the last week of October, there are already autumn leaves around the middle of the hike up to the water fall. If you want a more leisurely hiking pace, go here on a weekend. There are many restaurants, a coffee shop and many agricultural stores, but nobody speaks English. There are some street food, however, if you have allergies, the Ahjumma's will not be able to explain the ingreadients."
"A view to remember It was autumn and though it came later than predicted this year, the view was still amazing. I would definitely come again and try out the trails. Went up through cable car and the hiking to the peak from cable car station on top, was not steep (+ stairs). I would like to enjoy just sitting still while watching the view for at least an hour up there. Unfortunately due to time constraint, was not able to do it. If you stay in Seoul and would like to come here, make sure you arrive at the express terminal station early in the morning to take earliest bus to Sokcho!"
"Nice walking Be aware that this park is very busy!  Weekends are a no no, so we arrived on a Monday but even then it was crowded.  However we saw some lovely Autumn colours and the paths are quite good to walk.  We did take one to the round rock and this wasn?™t so easy for walking - a lots of steps made of large rocks really. Enjoyable though."
"Autumn Beauty We enjoyed a full day in the park. We appreciated views of beautiful riverscapes, autumnal tree foliage and rugged mountain formations. The varying angles and levels of light added to the spectacle. Be warned: we were there on a Monday and it was very busy with long queues of cars to enter the site and lots of people."
"Seoraksan National Park The park is Very well maintained considering that it is quite a huge park. Requires lots of walking, for some hiking. Take the cable car for a closer view of Mt. Seorak & its surroundings. There is a big sitting buddha & temple as well. The natural landscape of the park makes for a relaxing ambience."
"One of the prettiest mountain parks in South Korea Come in early October and look for the Autumn colours.  Climb the heights to one side, or take the cable car on the other.  And indulge in the countryside drinks (dong dong ju) and the mushrooms.  Beautiful views, and hiking at all levels of physique."

"Korean nature Excellent park with many good though steep walks. The entrance with the many food places is a little off putting, but most visitors do venture beyond this area. Well maintained paths and clearly signposted."
"a scenic mountains and fun cablecar the park itself is average however the mountains surrounding it are really beautiful. If you love hiking, it is one of the best place, I guess. However, I visited with my family, we opted for the cable-car. there was a long waiting. if you are not lucky you will not see anything even if you are on the top of the mountain. check the weather, and avoid cloudy-rainny days to get the best view from the top."
Tiring but worth it Ulsan Rock was spectacular and beautiful! Needless to say it was tiring but definitely worth! Didnt manage to visit the others but heard its good too!
"Wonderful visit We spent a lovely couple of Spring days exploring the various paths and sights of Seoraksan National Park. There's a lot to see and do, and even though there are a lot of people at the park's entrance and going up and down the cable car, it's also a breeze to leave the crowds behind with a bit of walking. We loved it, and I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys getting out and about. Our two sons (10 and 12), enjoyed the challenge of spotting the many birds and mammals about, and none of the walks were too challenging or difficult."
"Gorgeous nature This National Park is a must see when visiting Korea. We booked a hotel in nearby Sokcho to visit the park multiple days. There are lots of different hikes which will show you the absolute best of the natural beauty of Korea. Some hikes can be challenging, so make sure you start your hike well equipped ."
"Day trip to Seoraksan The scenery on the way to Seoraksan National park was beautiful. We had to go through several tunnels and it was nice. Got to Seoraksan and took a cable car up to the Gwongeumseong Fortress. The view from the top was amazing. Not far from the entrance, we can go to see the Buddha statue and the Sinheungsa Temple. Keep following the temple wall you can make your way towards the Heundeulbawi rock and then the famous Ulsan Rock. The walk was not that hard, but the climb from Hendeulbawi to Ulsanbawi is quite challenging if this is your first time hiking. The walk in the forest is really nice. It is so calm and relaxing. If you have plenty of time, you can visit other places in Seoraksan National Park. Since I joined a day trip to this place, I don't have enough time to explore the whole place. But if you only have limited of time, going to Gwongeumseong Fortress is a must, then you can take either Biseondae course or Ulsanbawi course (depending on the time you have). All and all, this place is worh visiting."
"Superb mountain view, cable car and good hiking trails It was good experience. The rock mountain is good for all ages. Getting to the mountain peak via cable car makes it possible for children or even ladies with flat sandals or slippers to climb the peak. The peak was crowded with people, even with children. The mountain view is breathtaking and you can see the small Sokcho City and Sea of Japan from the top. There were other rock mountain and several nice places that can be hiked in the area/park, but unfortunately I was not able to reach those places due to time constraint. Definitely will be back for the Ulsan Bawi and other parts that are worth exploring!"
"Great nature park From Sokcho city, I took bus 7 or 7-1 to this national park. T-money card is accepted for bus, ride is about 25 mins. The entrance ticket is 3,500 won. I started by heading to Biryong Waterfall, a relatively easy hike. I took about 1 hour 45 mins round trip, including a 20 mins break at the waterfall.Next, I took a cable car to Gwongeumseong Fortress. The cable car ride is rather expensive, 10,000 won return ticket for 5 mins ride one way. At the top cable car station, it takes about 10 mins to climb up the steps to reach the fortress. It was not overly crowded as the area is spacious. Unfortunately, it was drizzling and foggy when I was there. I managed to take a few clear shots in between the fog arriving and disappearing. I then took the cable car back and had lunch at the food court of cable car station.Initially, I planned to hike Ulsanbawi Rock after lunch. It was still raining and view was foggy. I decided to visit the nearby Sinheungsa Temple before calling it a day and then return the next day. Fortunately, my travel plan is flexible to accommodate this. I was glad the next day was bright and sunny, with clear blue sky. I finally hike to Ulsanbawi Rock, which was the highlight for me. See my separate review. Overall, I had a memorable time visiting Seoraksan National Park and highly recommend it."
"Best hike EVER :) don't miss it I have to say I'm not a hiker. Before coming to Korea I didn't like hiking. But I fell in love with Seoraksan. I did 2 hikes there. One day I went to Ulsanbawi rocks (pretty light hike, many stairs) - all in all around 2 hours to get to the top. A lot temples and nice views along the way. But best was a hike to the top  Daechongbong Peak. It's really long hike, you have to start early because it is 11km to the top and it took me almost 5 hours getting to the top but it was definately worth it. You have nice views almost always. first 3km are just a walk, than anouther 3,5 km it is a light hike and last 4,5 km are deadly :D but don't worry, because I'm not an experienced hiker and I did it with some breaks at pretty good time. It is worth going hiking even if you don't get to the top. Somewehere in the 1/3 of the road between Huiungak shelter and Socheongbong peak there is an oservation deck with the best view (I spent there 15 minutes while going up and another hour going down) so preserve until than. Enjoy hiking ;) Beautiful views I went with my children and elderly parents, therefore took the cable car and unfortunately, the staff packed in as many people as possible. Cable car ride is just a short 8minutes ride. I would have done a hike up if it was just me. Lovely views at the top once you exit the cable car plus you can also do another short hike up to a small peak where you can get lovely views of Sokcho.After taking the cable car down, we walked to a nearby river and the temple. Well worth the day trip."

"Seoraksan Is a temple surrounded by mountains, good atmosphere, convenient transportation, Is a place to ask for blessings, climbing or walking  But there is a rule prohibiting animals from entering beautiful some amazing walks and cable car to the top was an incredible view. A must see if you are in the area Nature at its best What a wonderful place, took our dogs hiking. Weather was a bit overcast in the morning, but by mid day the sun was shining and it was time to find the beach."
"Gorgeous park, easy public transport from Seoul Online ticket reservation using the Kobus website - it is indeed possible using a foreign credit card and doing your best to fill in the boxes.In relation to the mobile number requirement, I googled and found a suggestion to use something in this format010 1234 5678And it worked.  I took note of the number but the counter clerk only asked for my credit card. The online system reserves your ticket and seat but you still need to have it issued at the counter.Clean and spacious bus with good seats. It took about 3 hours to get to Sokcho's Express Bus Terminal.If you arrive at the Sokcho Express Bus Terminal, you need to cross the road and take either bus 7 or 7-1 to the park. These are local buses, so there is no luggage space and you just need to lug your bag up. Cost is 1400 KRW and I had exact change. Stop names are announced, including in English. The last stop was at Kensington Stars Hotel/car park of the Seoraksan National Park. You can walk through the car park to the hotel.The hotel is sort of colonial in style and has various Halls of Fame - different floors for actors, singers, movie stars, ambassadors...and the Abbey Road bistro on the top floor is a museum and treasure trove of Beatles memorabilia - photos, platinum records, a suit belonging to John Lennon, a guitar signed by all 4 Beatles ...The location of the hotel can't be beat as it is literally 500m from the entrance to Mount Sorak National Park.At the car park entrance to the hotel is a 7 Eleven which has some basic foodstuffs but obviously a limited selection. I believe there is a microwave for heating up the ready-to-eat meals.Two easier walking courses in Seoraksan that I did were Bisongae Rock and Biryong Falls. Do note that this simply means that the beginning portions are relatively level and non-pebbley but that the last few hundred metres involve bouldery rock bits to step/ climb over which require shoes with good grip and a good attention span to guard against slipping. The bouldery bits generally involve some sort of upward climb. Not undo-able but best to be prepared for it and be clear what one's limits are.The cable car - it stops running when the winds are strong but I got lucky and it started up on my last day. Good views from the top!It's probably the beginning of the peak season now and the park wasn't crowded so it was perfect!"
"Beautiful park , but I've found to many garbage on the path, please keep your garbage with you, nature don't need that!"
The waterfall hiking trail was AMAZING Don?™t forget the waterfall hiking trail. We couldn?™t believe that we hadn?™t seen a single person on the trails and IT was BEAUTIFUL!
"Beautiful Cherry Blossom We don't expect there will be cherry blossom blooming here, since all the prediction it will come around 9 April, we go there at 4 April and a stunning cherry blossom has arrived early, even all korean people we met very surprise, we even stop at the road to take a picture of the cherry blossoms. memorable time we can't take the cable car since it closed due the heavy wind."
beautiful scenery One of the places we visited in our package to in korea. It has many beautiful scenery and good flowers and cherry blosooms. Took a lot of pictures.
"Movie-worthy views My daughter and I visited Seoraksan as part of a month long trip around South Korea. We stayed in Sokcho-si for 3 nights and this proved to be an excellent choice as a local number 7 or 7-1 bus takes you into the gates of the National Park for 1250?©The park has multiple routes and trails you can follow of varying distances and heights to climb. There is a cable car to one of the peaks but we opted for a 3km climb (mostly steps but initially there are rocky paths to clamber up) to Towangseongpokpo. The MOST STUNNING views when I finally made it to the top! My daughter danced on ahead like it was no effort ?™‚I?™ve attached a few pictures - if you are visiting South Korea and are able to squeeze in a day trip to Seoraksan, I promise it will be worth it!"
Great place to spend a day or exploring waterfalls and views.
In the park you can take a walk to see 3 waterfalls with great views and nice scenery.There is also a cable car which is a bit expensive (10000 won) but it is a one off opportunity to see a great view.There is a short walk from the top of the cable car for views.There are 2 other main walks .One taking around 2 hours and the other around 4 hours.Small entrance fee and parking fee into the park also.

"Comment on difficulty of hike Very nice park, as everyone else has said. I just want to add that I did the ""4 hour"" hike to Ulsanbawi Rock, which is the most difficult hike in that part of the park. I am a 65 year old man, in decent, but not great, shape. The walk was strenuous, especially the last 0.6 km. Uphill on steps or a rock path. By the time I reached the top, I was quite pooped. But glad I did it. For someone younger in good shape it shoud not be that hard. For someone older or in poor shape, it will be a challenge. Also, I did it in April, so it wasn't very hot."
"I love this place (April 2018) A great place to see a different side of Seoul. It is about a 3 hours busride away! For people who can't walk well it is still a great place to go as you do not need to hike up, due to cable cars. There are also diffenr routes you can take around the park. Which have different levels.From the cable car it is another 10 minutes max hike up to the top!"
Breathtaking !
"Wow! What a nice park. We spent the day at the park, went up to the rocks and took the cable car.  The views are amazing. Access from Sokcho is by bus 7-1 and takes about 50 minutes. Definitely worth seeing."
"Seoraksan National Park Seoraksan impressed me with its amazing Mountain View?™s. One of the best places to visit in South Korea.?‘?½ Beautiful autumn colours of the trees Upkeep of the place was well maintained. Though it was chilly (1degreeC), we enjoyed walking through and browsing around the different sections of the park, stopping now and then to take photos or buy some snacks. What brought out the ""oohs"" and ""wows"" were the glorious and beautiful autumn leaves of the trees! Different and various hues of yellow, orange, red, rust and brown.....so picturesque, what a lovely sight!"
"Entrance staff very rude. Maybe they cant communicate well. Park is great Need spend more times here as we have 2 great days here. One day for waterfall, one day for cable car up."
"Enjoy One Day Trip This place is awesome. Beautiful view and variety of choices of hiking routine. Too bad I have insufficient time, otherwise will be visiting at least 4 days to explore more. Will definitely come back."
Feel the nature and deeper background of Korean Buddhism.

"Good to see One of the famous attraction in South Korea. The scenery is beautiful, has some ancient Korea building around. It is very quiet and comfortable walking the trail."

Beautiful I had a great time here and enjoyed the view. I didn?™t mind the long steps to get to the peak.It was well worth it.
"Beautiful National Park I spent two days exploring the national park. I did several trails and enjoyed them all.The most popular one is the one up to Ulsanbawi Rock. Lots of Koreans were hiking up there. I didn?™t get all the way because my legs were tired though. There are numerous temples along the way. Gyejoam is well worth visiting. They also had wifi there.The route to the waterfalls is less busy. The waterfalls weren?™t overly impressive when I visited in November but the hike was nice. You can go further to an observation deck, but this involves climbing 850+ stairs. The view from the top is stunning.The trail to Biseondae Rock is the easiest. For most of the way it is a road. It does run beside a river and the scenery the whole way is spectacular. Most people stop at the rock but if you are really adventurous, you can continue to Geumganggul Cave. I only saw two other people doing that and they didn?™t go all the way to the cave. This is the steepest route in the park, but it?™s worthwhile when you reach the top.There is also a cable car that will take you to a viewpoint. Toilets are on all the routes. There are also cheap restaurants at the base as well. The coffee roasters is great at the end of a cold day. Overall, I had a memorable time hiking through Seoraksan National Park and highly recommend it."
"Stunning Maple Colours in Autumn Stunning maple colours in autumn, would recommend at least two days here to fully appreciate the vast park and hiking trails. We took the cable on the first day and did a short hike to the fortress. Next day we took a more demanding hike to Ulsan-bawi - they were a lot of stairs but definitely manageable for anyone with a reasonable level of fitness. Just take your time and slowly enjoy the sights - no rush in this tranquil place. Love how there was no litter in the park - South Koreans are really respectful to their national parks in this regard.Visited 22nd and 23rd October 2018 - stayed two nights overnight at the nearby Kensington Stars Hotel."
"Great place Seoraksan is very famous in korea... while we went there, only local korean visitors no one foreigner/ western... the place is good but far from seoul... the weather while cold is very cold... we can use cable car... we also can praying in big Buddha here (there?™s shop that can give you stick to pray or rice that can you use for praying)..."
"Great National Park It is a great national park that travelers could select their appropriate route of hiking trail. However, the writer did only travel the temple, Sinheungsa, owing to the schedule and weather considerations."
Beautiful Seoraksan Beautiful place of flora and fauna to spend a few hours.  It's a good trek up the summit so be sure you wear the right shoes.  The park hosts Buddhist temples Baekdamsa and Sinheungsa.  The tea house run by the monks is a nice place to take a break.
many adventures + hidden jjimjilbang + decent chow + big buddha!
"Very much worth the 3 hour trip from Seoul.  Get there early on weekends for decent parking though they do a great job double and triple parking cars.  Trouble is there's a huge jam outside.Big to-dos: eat at any of the various restaurants in the main ""village.""  reminiscent of US national parks with their concessions built close to the main attractions seoraksan has around 15 restaurants that serve everything from korean tradition to burgers.  lotsa makgeolli too natch.take the tram to the top of one of the nearby peaks for a quick hike up to the top.  great pics.  gotta love the pines clinging to the jagged summits like a fairytale asian postcard.the buddhist village from the 1600s to 1700s is whimsical mystical and operational.  monks eat together study together and maybe train together (though we didnt see that unfortunately) in the made-for-hollywood temple courtyard. you can imagine them practicing kung fu there, if they do that. really neat place. and of course there's the gigantic buddha just outside.up a 10-11 percent grade through a separate entrance to the park there's a mini oncheon and a great restaurant. it's called pillye germanium hot spring and its got an outdoor pool.  the water is green. very pretty spot. the restaurant serves traditional korean but it's chopped up cooked up fresh right in front of you in a wooden mountain cabin with a wood stove cozying up the place. sweet spot.great hike up to a waterfall that must look great in spring. the hike starts in the main concession valley and goes a couple of miles straight up a river thanks to steel stairs the park's built into the side of the canyon.  very pretty up top but strenuous fo sho."
"Breathtaking & Beautiful We came over 2 days at the end of October, where the autumn season is still in bloom. We attempted a few trails over the 2 days. The easiest is the Biseondae trail, where the path is pretty flat and wide for the most part. It's essentially a forest trail. The second easiest, in my opinion, is the trail to the Gwongeumseong Fortress, which is accessible via cable car. The cable car is the fun part, but from there, is a roughly 10minute climb of steps and stairs to reach the 'peak'.Consider walking the Biryong falls trail if you enjoy a forest bathing experience followed by stair climbing for the remaining 1/3 journey to reach the Yukdam falls and Biryong falls. The last 400m stretch to Biryong falls is the most tiring. Finally, conquer the Hyundeubawi trail which is an uphill climb up slopes and stone paved tracks for the most part. But the autumn scenery here is the best among all the trails.Finally, if you are really fit, then you can attempt the final 1km from the Hyundeubawi Rock to the Ulsanbawi Rocks. This part of the trail is rated Advanced, so be prepared for some tough climbing.Seoraksan National Park is nature's gift and a must-visit Beautiful Scenery All Around Our tour itinerary included visiting this beautiful Seoraksan National Park, also known as Mount Seorak. Autumn here is so beautiful. We also took the cable car up to the only station. Then walked up the trail to the peak. It was very tiring but the fresh air and wonderful view was worth the effort. Remember to bring along your Walking Poles the next time you come. Saw many people, especially the locals, who went hiking around the many hiking trails. Great place to visit."
Magical!
"The beauty of nature is just breathtaking! I would recommend to go there in October, really worth visiting."

"A Magnificent National Park; Go in Autumn South Korea is proud of its national parks and Seoraksan is emblematic.Featuring magnificent landscape, including streams, falls, forests, temples and animals, Seoraksan, the beauty of Seoraksan was amplified by the fall colors, enough so to make we want to return each October.  A moderately challenging trail parallels a downstream river leading to a small waterfall, nestled in the forest.The tram ride to a high point offers nice views of the valley to the coast but we found it over-rated and dispensible; better to be in the park than above it.The park is popular; expect crowds."
"Beautiful fall color, a bit too crowded It?™s very beautiful park, especially in autumn. A lot of hiking trails which are well managed and clean. Avoid weekend if possible, it?™s very crowded."
"Slightly disappointed for autumn Went for autumn viewing but was too late and all the leaves have mostly withered. Supposed the mountain should be very beautiful in full bloom. Summer should be very scenic with water flowing, green leaves and beautiful sky. Took the cable car to the observatory tower and hike all the way up to the peak. Not a difficult route , can attempt even when you are not equipped with hiking stuffs. Cable car is by timing. Pretty organised but should also have English speaking guide so that foreigners know when to start queuing for the cable car."
"Easy trekking available Upon persuasion by a Korean friend, my sister and I decided to try walking the easiest trails at outer Sorak.  We did our walks on 24 & 25 Oct when the autumn foliage was pretty nice.  We did Biryeong Falls on our first trek and Bisondae Rocks the next day.  Most delighted to find that both trails were easy and did not require serious hiking gear.  On the way to Bisondae Rocks, we passed Sinheungsa Temple and the magnificent Buddha.  Also popped in to the specialty coffee shop near the temple to use their clean toilet and enjoy their lovely decor.To ensure we start our walk without huge crowds, we decided to stay at the Kensington Stars Hotel, just 5 minutes away from the Park entrance.  Started our walk before 8.30am and only met massive crowds of people on the trail during our return trek.Based on our experience, we would stay 2 nights in future - arriving in middle to late afternoon to avoid the traffic jam on the road to the hotel which is also the same road to the Park.  This way, we would have 2 clear mornings to start our walks early before the crowds arrive.  Of course, we will stay on weekdays to avoid weekenders from Seoul.  Best time to leave for Seoul would be immediately after lunch so we can avoid the evening rush hour."
"Cold but Scenic Mountain View Once again, in Korea where things are really Cold, nearly Winter, but not quite yet winter.  The scene was beautiful with natural and artificial 'decoration'.  I'm sure Spring would be just as nice."
"Not what I hope for I went there on Nov 1st and I must say that it's not really fun up there. I chose the cable car route (because my friends are too tired to do the tracking). I have to say it's boring and the trees are already losing it's leaves so it's pretty ordinary and barren for me. Nothing special. I think it's better if you choose other route like tracking to the waterfall if you're fit enough and skip the cable car route. Or just go to the Sinheungsa temple and enjoy the scenery rather than wasting 10.000 won for the cable car Worth the Visit We booked trough an agency because this pace if quite far from the city.  October is the best time to visit, autumn season, the trees are beautiful, the weather is really cold. Though lots of people and limited time was given to us, we did not really have time to visit the restaurants and eat, it was worth it.  I will definitely going back to Mt. Seorak."
"Hello autumn The best time to visit seoraksan mountain on october when autumn. The leafts many colors. But maybe you must prepare rain coat, cause maybe rainy at the time.The entry ticket 3500 won per one. And you can trekking or by cable car to the mountain. And for cable car fare 10.000 waon for roundtrip.IG@tripout.id Highlight of Korea."
"My Korean wife took me here. I'm a Kiwi and love the outdoors. This place would rival anywhere in NZ. The scenery was breath taking. The autum leaves were so varied and colorful. The cable car was not working due to the wind but we hiked up past the water falls to around 500 meters for an amazing view. Not so many people there either.So peaceful, beautiful and a great day out in nature."
Beautiful and relaxing scenery.
Best to go here in Autumn during the color transition of the trees/leaves. Uphill climb thus wear comfortable clothes. The mountain scenery is so beautiful. You can enjoy the stillness of nature and capture its beauty in your cameras. A lot of restaurants also if you get hungry. With cable car if you want to see the top of the mountain but you have to brave the long line for 1-2 hours if you get lucky.

"Hikes for all ages but can be crowded There are a number of trails here for all levels, from extremely flat and paved terrain to more advanced ones. You can also see a lot here: waterfalls, caves, and peaks. During the peak season in the autumn though, it gets very crowded, and it is NOT advisable to bring a car all the way to the park unless you want to spend hours on the road to Seoraksan. Go on a weekday if you can, or stay in a hotel near the park entrance if you really need to go on weekends during peak season (autumn). You can also go really early -- the crowd starts coming in around 10am or so. The traffic was also better on Sunday, since most people prefer to come from Seoul on Saturdays.I found the place a bit too touristy though. In some ways, it's good (toilets along the Ulsanbawi trail are really convenient) but for some who prefer wilder trails, it may not be the best. Personally, I prefer Hallasan to Seoraksan, but then the two are like apples and oranges. It all boils down to personal preference."
"The most popular mountain park in Korea This is the most beloved mountain park for Koreans.I also recommend visiting here to foreign travelers visiting Korea for longer than two weeks. The true mountain climbing requires at least one night at the shelter(reservation is essential).- How to access:1) From Sokcho(Sogongwon Main): #7 and #7-1 Bus from Sokcho to Sogongwon Entrance. The first bus is before 6 am.2) From Inje(Baekdam Village): There's a bus from Inje Bus Terminal to Baekdam Village. And from the visitor center, there's a shuttle to Baekdamsa Temple.3) From Yangyang(Osaek Mineral Water Area): There's a bus from Yangyang intercity bus terminal.- Sogongwon Course:This is the most popular and crowded access to the mountain. Very crowded. Many shops and restaurants. There are four different routes.First, Towangseong Course is to see three amazing waterfalls. Seniors and young kids can reach until the second falls. Towangseong Falls at the end is tough to reach with many steep steps. But, it's magnificent. 3 hours course.Second, Gwongeumseong Course is reachable by cable cars. The easiest. And it has an amazing view.Third, Biseondae Observatory and Geumganggul Cave Course. Very easy trail until Biseondae. 90 min until coming back. After Biseondae, it's a real hiking from here with above average level. Mountain shoes are necessary just in case. Healthy visitors might be able to come back seeing Gemganggul Cave within 3 hours. There are shelters in this route and it's available to finish at other entrance.The last, Heundeulbawi Rock and Ulsanbawi Rock. 2 hours. It's okay level for healthy ones. Ulsanbawi has a wonderful view.- Baekdam Course:There are MANY restaurants and lodges in Baekdam Village.This is a route to see mountain climbing or to have an easy walking in the valley. Very crowded in the morning. There are pebble towers, pure water, temples, fall foliages, etc. Baekdamsa is really beautiful temple and temple stay is available. The trail to Suryeomdong Shelter.is very beautiful and accessing to the stream is allowed. If any family wish to see fall foliage, I recommend this route.- Osaek Course:Osaek Mineral Water Area is good to get refreshed. This route has the shortest course to Daecheongbong Peak, the highest peak in Seoraksan.- Comparing to the number of common tourists, there were much fewer mountain climbers. In the middle of mountain, it was hard to meet others.- It's not easy to see any animals but squirrels. Sometimes little lizards were found.- For the climbers:Seoraksan is not a smooth mountain. Trekking shoes are required. Many tracks aren't as tough as I anticipated. But, slopes and steps last very long. It's exhausting. Even if it's not a steep ground, it can be slippery with wet leaves and rocks. Take each step slowly and don't be ambitious to avoid fatigue.Dinosaur Ridge is a very popular track. There are several shelters nearby. And you need to rest enough before and after since it's quite tough.You MUST either come down or arrive at the shelter before it gets dark. The sun goes down very soon. And never try to sleep outside. It's risky and not permitted.You should reserve the shelter on the website in advance. It sells out early in popular season. It costs below 15,000 won mostly. You can buy things, cook and sleep. The one I stayed wasn't that comfortable. No drinking water. No shower. Old toilets.There aren't many signs while climbing. You may confront disconnected tracks of 3~10m on the route which can put you in distress heading wrong directions. You'll probably meet the restarting point if you move forward. Or you can go up a little bit to look down and come back."
Seoraksan I highly recommend a visit to Mt Seorak especially during the autumn.Took the cable car and was blown away by the beautiful autumn foliage!!Long journey from Seoul but definitely an unforgettable trip.
"Good place but extraordinary Visited here with family on September 2018.We took cable car to the mountain but it turned out the distance was very short, less than 10minutes, so not very exciting.The rest room on the mountain was very very dirty :(After went down from the mountain, we just went to the river to take some pics.There is a big buddha statue in the park just like in Hongkong.For me the place was good but extraordinary."
"Dream Park Any solo traveler, family and  tourist group who love natural park in winter, don't  miss this destination. It takes 20 minutes from Sokcho by bus. Many activities wait for visitors : hiking, trekking, taking cable car to the top of a snowy mountain, walking  to see snowy ground & trees or doing merit at a temple. Tasting Korean lunch in the park food court  is a must."
"Autumn folk in seoraksan We came here on the first day of Chuseok holiday. Suprisingly, it was more crowded than our imagination. Anyway, the cable car is really worthy attraction (although you need to come early to get the ticket. We came at 10 am and the earliest ticket that avainle is the 12.30 cable car) Breathtaking view We came on the first day of Chuseok holiday because we thought that there wouldn?™t be a lot of people on the day but we were wrong. There were a lot of people and the bus we took was trapped 2 km before the main gate so it was better for us to get off and walking to the main gate. We arrived around 10 o?™clock to buy the cable car?™s tickets but the line was already crowded. The fastest car we could take was 12:30 and they said that it was 4 times more crowded on autumn foliage. But I must say that it was worth it!! The view was really wonderful from the top. You can see the mountains and East Sea from above!!"
"Hikers' playground No wonder Seoraksan has a reputation of one of the most beautiful and popular national parks in South Korea. The nearest seaside town Sokcho (2.5 hour by bus from Seoul, then 35 mins by bus to the NP) is friendly and relaxing, and Seoraksan NP has almost everything for everyone. The ground area by the river is pleasant with a nice outdoor Buddha statute and a small temple, visitors can take a short cable car ride to enjoy the scenery, then walk 20 mins to the wonderful Gwongeunseng Fortress Wall.In addition to the must do Ulsanbawi trek (4 hour return), there are many other treks from 2 to 4 hours to choose from. I recommend Biryong Falls (i.e. flying dragon) then continue up to the Observatory to view the Towangseong Falls & amazing surroundings. The 1.7km trek to Biryong Falls is nice and easy; but the last 0.4km up the Observatory requires climbing 900 steep steps! It's almost as demanding as the Ulsanbawi trek! That said, the view is equally rewarding."
"Most beautiful view in Korea I have to admire that I was extremely lucky enough at that day. When we took the cable car from the park 10,000 kwon for adults and 6,000 kwon for children, the weather was foggy on the top of 700 m suddenly clouds started to disappear and mountains tops started to appear and shine. The view was glorious and stunning. Temperature was around 18 C.. everything was perfect except the timing. They told us it?™s 6:00 pm and cable car will be closed. We had to leave the place. Please enjoy the photos as I cannot say more."
Like a miramar map on PUBG!
"just kidding, It?™s a lil bit rocky hills and easy to hike. But don?™t get fooled, once you got to the peak you'll see why It?™s a five-star destination."

Soraksan total tranquility.
"We were here about 35yrs ago and the park has really changed with made pathways, bridges and lots of places to eat and rest.  There is also a cable car to take you to the top to get a spectacular view of the surrounding area."
Breathtaking!
"It is certainly an amazing and breathtaking place to be. The view of the mountain as you arrive is already enough to make you be in awe.Admission fee is 3,000KRW for adults.I had initially wanted to take the 7hour climb to the highest peak. However my legs have not recovered from climbing Bukhansan two days ago. I had to cheat. Took the cable car (10,000KRW). The view on both sides as you ascend is awesome. At the back of the station are steps to take you to one of the lower peak. There are proper steps made and a short path of stones. A short climb. The view is ... WOW! The view of a valley is.. amazing. I have attached pics i took with my phone. Most of my pics are with a proper camera.Directions from Seoul:1. Bus to Sokcho from Express Bus Terminal (approx 3 hours).2. Cross the road and find a bus-stop on the right side.3. Take either bus 7 or 7-1 to Seoraksan National Park.The peak is covered in mist if you arrive very early. It will clear up around 9.00am. That will be a better time to take the cable car."
We will be back to Seorak!
"This place was absolutely beautiful.  There was something for everyone; sightseeing, hiking, eating and shopping.  We spent the whole day hiking trails and enjoying the outdoors.  We did take the gondola ride to the top as well for some beautiful views of the surrounding area.  I would recommend doing that first as the lines will only get longer as the time gets later.  The views at Seoraksan left me speechless, so I will let the pictures do the talking!Enjoy!"
"Stunning Very user friendly Park esp for western (English speaking) visitors. All signs also in English, maps available in English. Naver map system gets you here easily if you are driving. Parking looks difficult if you get here past 10am though. We stayed at the Kensington and walked in and saw lines of cars daily. Entrance fee is 3,500KW per day and the hikes are very well marked and traveled. We only did outer Seoraksan trails and it was crowded but pleasant on a September weekend. Everyone appreciated our limited Hangul. Many hiking clubs trekking about. Plenty of food / snacks and trinkets for sale. The gondola is a must. Ulsanbowi a must. Waterfalls a little anticlimactic."
"Great National Park Seoraksan was phenomenal- we will be back to see it in more seasons for sure. The park is easily on par with the great Western parks in the U.S. as far as vistas are concerned. The trails were well maintained, and everything was clean and tidy. Recommend you fully research what trails you intend to take however - we had our two young boys, and a ?œmoderate hike??quickly turned into a mini-rock climbing adventure for them. (Proper shoes definitely help in that regard.) All in all the whole area is fantastic - we will be back."
Have been many times.
"I have been to Seoraksan several times since arriving in Korea close to five years ago, and it is one of my favorite National Parks in the Country. Typically, as with most people, I will hike to the ""rock,"" Ulsanbawi, which is about two hours round trip, before going to the waterfall. However, on my first trip, I went to the peak, which is 13~14 hours round trip. Make sure you bring lots of water and take care of your feet!"
"Heads up: locker storage not available until 9:30am We had read that the park offers locker storage, which is true, but the lockers are indoors at the visitor info center (inside the park gate) and that office does not open until 0930. We had already checked out of our hotel room and arrived there at 0630. The lockers are NOT accessible from the outside and they would not make exceptions for us unfortunately. We had to walk back to a hotel and coordinate luggage storage with them, which worked out fine but delayed us over an hour as we were trying to beat the heat and get an early start hiking.Other than that, this park is absolutely gorgeous and a must-see. We hiked Ulsanbawi Rock which was very challenging due to all the steep stairs but so worth it. Took about 4 hours up and back down.The park admission does not accept credit cards but cafes inside do."
"worth trip i was there during the autumn season. even its located quite far from seoul, there was so many tourists. when the leaves turn colour, it was a perfect place to take photo. for muslim, they also provide cable car to get to the middle of the peak then need to hike around 30 minutes to the peak. it was a worth trip."
Nice park Its 2 to 2 1/2 hours to Seoraksan from Seoul. It was raining and foggy. We took the cable and the visibility was poor. Its the popular thing to do and cost $10. It has several paved trails.  There are also restaurants in the park.
Good Hiking Trails I visited this park as part of a tour group during our 4-day Eastern Korea tour.  We hiked the 3.2 Km trail from Yongso Falls to Yaksuteo.  It was downhill most of the way and was a scenic hike.  Quite a bit of the trail consisted of wooden planks covered with rubber padding.  There is a Buddhist temple along this trail.Parts of the trail have shade but parts were directly in the sun and a hat and sunglasses are recommended.  A bottle of water would be helpful during the hike.

"The best park in Korea No trip to Korea is complete without a visit to Seoraksan National Park which has many hiking trails, temples, a cable car and a few places to eat. Most people would choose the hike to see Ulsanbawi Rock but on the way you will hike through a thick forest, pass three temples and see the Heundeulbawi Rock, a round rock finally balanced on a small rocky mound. The trail is hard going as it ascends most of the way with hundreds of steps but well worth doing. It will take about 3-4 hours, allowing for rests and photo stops."
Loved our hike to the temple!
"Cable car ride and hike up to the temple were the highlights of our family's trip here.  It was a tough hike, but we made it and it was worth it.  Great views!Clean and many helpful park workers."
"quite beautiful place in korea although i listened this place quite long time ago but it was quite beautiful which exceed my expectation. i visit here at quite early morning & reached Gwongeumseong Fortress, Biryong Falls &  Sinheungsa Temple. that was quite enjoyable. love it Great National Park A beautiful and large National Park and a must visit in the Sokcho area. There is plenty of nice landscaping and lots of space to roam. There is also an area with plenty of restaurants and shops to grab a bite to eat or a souvenir. Depending on how much time and stamina one has there are various sites to visit. We took the cable car up the mountain. The cable car is very busy, we went on a weekday and had to wait 25 minutes. Going up is a nice ride with great views. Up on the mountain I expected it to be much colder but the temperature and weather was very pleasant. From the arrival area one can hike up to the mountain from where the views are simple amazing. After coming back down with the cable car we went to the temple and enjoyed a nice stroll."
"One of the top places to visit in Sokcho This park is so large that going around the different trails and mountain paths will already take at least a day. Our group though only visited Mt Seorak, some of the surrounding park amenities and the giant Buddha. I'm a great fan of serene and peaceful places and if I could stay here I would. Just the view of the mountains whether from the ground or from the peak gives one a sense of awe at how wonderful our world is.Going up via cable car is the fast route up the mountain, but if backpacking and trails are your thing.I suggest you devote at least a day to visit this park. I guarantee that you'll love it.We also got to experience one of the Buddhist monks doing one of the daily prayers (I think it was for the unity of South and North Korea). Also a nice experience if you haven't experienced Buddhist monks during their daily prayers."
One of the most beautiful places on earth!
Seoraksan is one of the cleanest and best maintained parks I have visited. There are numerous trails offering a wide variety of levels of difficulty. Many trails are perfectly smooth to accommodate baby carriages and wheelchairs. Some trails are more challenging and appeal to the physically fit  hiker or climber. There is a tram ride which will take you to the rim of the canyon with stairs and trails for more adventuresome views of the valley below. The giant Buddha is magnificent.
"Wrong day With it?™s highest point 1,708 m above ground Seoraksan is one of the beautiful mountain in South Korea. Stopped by Shinheungsa temple inside Seorksan National park. Beautiful temple with lovely architecture. Surroundings wasn?™t visible clearly due to bad weather. Seated bronze Buddha statue known as Jwabul is well over 10m in height.Boarded seorak cable car at the foot of mountain for a 5 min ride to the top. Cable cars leave every 5 ??7 minutes. It was a rainy day views of the park was not that great through the cable car windows.After getting off, slippery floor and rain stopped me taking the 10 min hike up to the peak ??Gwogeumseong Fortress. My husband did. Wasn?™t clear day to get a birds eye view. I didn?™t miss much.Should have being a picturesque place, but we were there on the wrong day."
They magically peaceful place.
Seroksan mountain is a wonderful place to visit with family and friends. Cool Mountain Water is pulled in many areas as you ascend the mountain. Places where you can take a dip cool off and have some refreshments. It makes for a wonderful summer day trip. Fun for the whole family.
"Picturesque at the top Another one of our itinerary for our tour of South Korea. We took the cable car up to the top and the journey was breath-taking.At the top, I felt like singing ?œI?™m on the top of the world looking...?? The view was majestic with many different mountain peaks right in front of view. Definitely a must see in South Korea."
"Bliss and Adventure I spent the past two days visiting this park. Unfortunately, the past two days were cold and rainy days. However, that probably was The reason there were not huge crowds at the park as I had anticipated. I got there early both days which  I highly recommend.The first day I went was a Sunday And I climbed up to see the two rocks. There is a map that rates the trails and it is a good guide so you can know what to expect. The hike up to Heindeul and Ulsan rocks was an advanced level and I found the hike to be difficult due to the many many steps needed to climb.  The next day I did the cave hike, the end of which was expert level.  There was almost nobody else there due to the rain.  Towards the end I had to force myself on but felt great when I finally arrived, only to discover the cave was more an alcove with religious statues.  I am sure if the day had not been so cloudy I would?™ve had a fantastic view from up there. Another hike I did that day was on a trail marked as a meditation trail. It was an easy walk on a forest trail that I absolutely loved - I did not run across a single person on that trail.The third hike I did was the one along the river trail which brought me to see three waterfalls. All in all I had a marvelous time there in spite of the rain. I had a better time the   second day because I Put plastic booties over my shoes so I didn?™t have wet feet. That made a big difference.  I had lunch there one day and paid $15 for a potato pancake. It was expensive but tasted good."

"A place of serenity Calm, gentle breeze, beautiful nature and geological forms. I can almost spend myself a day in this place, especially next to the river. There is also a cable car to the top. During windy days the cable car will stop the operation. But you can wait a few minutes to see if they open again or not. You can also trek to the peak. There is also a temple there with a fountain. My guide told me the water is so clear that it is good for our health. Take a sip with the wooden spoon. But if you don't feel comfortable, you can use your hands too. I went to this place during spring, so nice to see the cherry blossoms carried by the winds. The weather was also perfect, not to cold but not too hot too."
"Climbing the mountain takes guts The weather was perfect, but the trek was not easy. Reaching the peak was an achievement, but I was getting jittery when going down. The wind is so strong at the peak but we were rewarded with a great sense of achievement, arguments and a wonderful memory of Sokcho."
"Beautiful nature and serene Buddhism We were blown away by this amazing place. Natural unspoilt beauty in abundance with so much to see and lots to discover, plenty of hiking trails too.We spent 3 hours here but wished that we had had more time and we were really lucky to have fantastic sunny weather.Since we had limited time here we decided to take the cable car ride, which I think is a must, it is also very reasonable as we paid around Â£7 (10,000 won) each for a round trip, however if the weather is very bad/windy the cable car does not operate.As you ascend in the cable car, the scenery is just breathtaking and you can see the giant Buddha from the Sinheungsa temple nestled below in the greenery.When you reach the top there are some viewing platforms and there is also a trail/stairs to reach the top of Gwongeumseong peak. We could hear ethereal Buddhist chants which made it all the more enchanting. It can get quite busy, but it's really worth going to the peak which is quite rugged and as thrilling as it is, care should be taken as you are very near the boundary of some steep mountain edges.There is also a little hidden temple down the side of the viewing platform called Aallack, it's a bit of a steep trail down with some stairs and rugged stones and can be quite stressful climbing back up but it's worth seeing and is very quiet and serene with not many tourists compared to the peak on our visit.Within three hours we managed to take the cable car, explore the peak, visit the Aallack temple and also the Sinheungsa temple complex with a walk by the lake, we were very satisfied with what we fitted into our time frame.Would definitely love to come back here and explore more, there is something for everyone!"
"good place to spend a day this is a must see and there is an unbelievable hike if your up to it .good food , and drink there . put good shoes for hiking on Wonderous I loved this place. My brother and I was here during mid May.  Me being a flower enthusiast was a little disappointed that we just missed the blossoms of spring.  Further, the weather for us was cloudy and drizzly.  However, I still went out and hiked amongst this beautiful landscape and I soon realised; different times, different experiences.  Whilst I didn't see certain things, what I got was amazing.  I saw seoraksan in a mistiful serene setting.  Regarding the flowers, I saw the Korean maple, drops of water on it's pretty leaves with it's pretty pink seedling leaves.I'm sorry I suck at describing.  It was very pretty suffice to say."
"Good hike, but the shelter staff in Huiungak was unfriendly!"
"I hiked to Jungcheong shelter for the sunrise the next day. It was a tough hike on certain sections, wonder how people made it down as coming down is harder on those rocks/boulders, need the ropes.I didnt make any reservation for the sleeping space in Jungcheong shelter as I wasnt planning hiking to the peak initially, but a friend I made along the trail encouraged me to make a hike to the peak. As I was passing through Huiungak Shelter, the shelter staff told me dont bother as the reservation for the bunks were full. He also told me this shelter that he manages is also full, and forbade me to even take a look. His discouraging attitude totally pissed people off. I managed to hike to Jungcheong Shelter and the friendly staff found me a bunk for the night. I was totally grateful to the staff at Jungcheong Shelter. They were the ones who helped foreign climbers and not chase them away.The instant rice and water they sold in the shelter were reasonably priced. The Korean climbers brought their own food for bbq. We didnt bring any so can only eat plain instant rice. Even if you bring your own instant noodles, they wont help you microwave it, they will only help microwave instant rice that they sell. They also rent blankets at reasonable price. The bunk room stink of urines in Jungcheong Shelter as the toilet fumes are blown into the sleeping place. The pungent smell refuse to go away all night. There is no water at this shelter, so you can only wash hands using your own bottled water.The sunrise view was amazing. We hiked down to another town Osaek after watching the sunrise, which was a shorterpath than the one we came up from. From there, we can walk to the bus stop and take a bus to Yangyang, before transfering to bus number 9 bound for Sokcho, the town where we came from."
30 years ago 3 of us 2 soldiers 1 katusa and my brand new humv ambulance went here for a weekend trip.still have the pictures .it was 1989 I was 21 .
"Hiking Just amazing!  Easy to follow trails of varying difficulty. Stunning, unspoilt scenery at every step. The monk chanting in the remote cave was the icing on the cake."
"Lovely tranquil area This National Park, a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, is a lovely tranquil area - except by the cable car terminus, where there are hordes of tourists.   We took the cable car up, 10K krw, and spent a short time hiking further up to get some great views of the surrounding area, all the way out to the sea.      We also did the approximately 2 hour hike up to the pair of waterfalls.   The first 2/3 of that hike is fairly level and easy while the remaining 1/3 is much harder with stairs and uphills,    It was not heavily trafficed.   The water flows down the mountainside at a fairly steep angle and generates a couple small waterfalls.      There are a few signs in English - but not many.     In the lower park area are a few food stalls/restaurants with limited and expensive dining options.."
"A must visit site in South Korea This beautiful mountain range is one of the most attractive and visited places in South Korea. There are several peaks in the range and clear hiking tracks are available. The place is easily accessible by road however almost every weekend, public holidays and during fall there is long traffic to enter the park. There are several hotels and guest houses in and around the park. It?™s recommended to visit the park early morning."

Beautiful An absolute must do! The location is incredible ~ beautiful scenery with hiking for all levels. Makes for a great getaway!
"seoraksan hiking stayed at kensington stars hotel, which is just beside the park entrance.  first day arrived at hotel around 4pm and hiked for 2 hr to biseondae and geun-gang-gul (cave).  second day hiked for about 5hrs to heundeulbawi (rock), ulsanbawi (rock), bi-ryeong falls, Towangseong Falls Observatory.from sokcho express bus terminal, cross the road to take bus 7 or 7-1 to kensington stars hotel which is the last stop.  about 20mins bus ride."
"Peaceful even if there's too much tourist Morning or Afternoon stroll is recommendable around the area, it is quite huge so be sure to wear comfortable shoes.  A trek to the peak is a must, you'll be meet with stunning view and a peaceful ambiance. I bet the  scenery will be magnificent during winter, since we've been there during spring only few snow caps are on the peak."
"Delightful The early parts of this park area a delightYou get charged for parking,  4000 won,  then there is another ticket desk for 2500 won each to enterWe went as far as the temple.A nice serene place that few tourists seemed to reachNice, large Buddha statue on the way there Lovely park but.."
Don't plan big hikes in the dry season because they close off the major trails for fire risk. I was unaware of this and also affected Oedaesan National Park further south. As it was I made the most of one day filled up with some spectacular walking. The valley floor is littered with eateries and a bit Disney for my liking but this is an important park for Koreans and not all of them are capable of hiking into the hills. I will return another day and do the more serious stuff.
Great National Park - nice walks This is a great place to visit. You decide what sort of walk you want to do - Easy to hard.It can be very cold here so make sure you have warm clothing. The gondola is great and so is the view from the top of Mt Seorak. On a sunny day with a little bit of snow about - gorgeous Road trip This is a must! The hike up to Ulsan Rock is tough in the last K but so worth it. Lovely area   First section is easy. Pay for car park and entry but worth it.
"Picturesque It's my first-time experience the snow and snow lightly during my visit. so beautiful, went up to the hill using cable car, the view is amazing, just take my breath away. Lots of snow up there. After 10 mins hike went down to explore the park, there was a temple and big Buddha statue. The park also has a nice view, I almost didn't notice the hours I spend walking. Definitely will come back again someday in autumn Nice big park After we enter the national park, We took a cable car up to a hill. From there, we had a 10 mins hike. Beautiful scenery and wind.We explore the park after we took the cable car down. There are two Prayer places. As the trees has no leaf and no flower when we were there, the park was not as nice as we have seen 11 years back.Nevertheless, we enjoyed the walk.Spend at least half a day here."
Beautiful!
We visited the park while there was a lot of snow around and in fact it snowed lightly during our visit.It is such a tranquil setting and a joy to walk around.

"Very Special Place(s) Hike(s) If you just have one day = Ulsanbawi hike.  Recommend getting on trail before 0900 for smaller crowd to/on the top. Bringing 2 bottles of auga and a sack of snack should make it comfortable.  Have a charged battery for tons of pics.If you have the option of going on different days, check the forecast for a better visibility day (after a rain is usually better).  As always sunscreen and a hat.   IF you have more time 2nd hike choice is Biryong Falls trail(as w/ most waterfall hikes time of year matters greatly for waterflow), 3rd is Geumganggul cave/Buddhist shrine (shallow cave).  The cable cars are a nice option if youve got health issues impacting your ability to hike, but if your wheels and lungs are good = Take a Hike!  :) Magnificent View Perfect and great mountain view at Mount Seorak. You can take a cable car direct to the top of the mountain or use a jungle trail to reach the top with different mountain view.."
"must visit spot in South Korea there's a large Budha statue inside, and try to go up using cable car and walk upper outside.best view at winter. photo spot around.cafe and snack available."
Picturesque!!
"We went there on a private tour last 24th December. It was so cold that day and it was raining non-stop. When we went down from the car, the mountain greeted us and it was a magnificent sight. Cable car ride was nice and short. It was much better when you get to the top, especially for most of us who were experiencing our first snow fall! You can also get hot coffee and ice cream at the top!"
Wonderful & Magnificient views!
Went there in Fall & the color of the mountain was wonderful. There are museums which kept a lot of things from Old Korea.
"Bad weather It was too windy and ticket for cable car was suspended. It is really frustrating to see other people able to change their ticket and able to take the ride. That was ridiculous and make no sense. Counter staff asks us to wait, which we did till 4 pm and walked away. We know it was a great view but unfortunately circumstances did not help us."
"Beautiful Autumn Leaves Visited Seoraksan with friends in End October and amazed by the colorful autumn leaves. If time allowed, we would trek along the path all the way to the peak, but instead we took the cable car."
"One of KoreaÂ´s top sghts especially in fall We planned our tour to South Korea to see the coloured leaves in fall. That is the season to go there. We were not the only ones. Bus loads of Koreans had the same idea, all dressed in expensive and professional outdoor equipment. We thought all intended for expeditions in the Himalayas. Trekking in that park is very popular, and a visit is worth the detour."
"Famous Bear Statue The landscape was beautiful in early december, since it?™s almost winter time. I took a bit long walk from the drop off to the famous bear statue. Then, me and my friends took a cable car that can carry around 50 people in one time. We continue to walk on the provided stairs until we reach the top of the mountain. The view was breathtaking, but you have to find a spot or share spot with others to take a photograph. Along the way back and the cable car station, there?™re some cafes and restaurants. But if you don?™t have enough time, there?™re some coffee vending machine that cost you around 50 - 100 won."
"Blown Away We signed up a day tour with Ktourstory (booked through Funtastic Korea) to Mount Seorak and Naksansa Temple.  Finding the bus at Myeondong Station was a little chaotic as there were tons of different tour groups and the guides were not well differentiated.  Nevertheless, our guide Finn was friendly and approachable and the rest of the day went on smoothly.After a short toilet break in Hongcheon, we moved on to Seoraksan National Park.  Arrived at 11am and was told to board the bus again at 3pm.  4 hours, great!We visited on a cold day, -11Â°C with winds of 5.6m/s.  Finn told us to hurry, as the cable car may close if the winds get any stronger.  But we made it!The views at Gwongeumseong Fortress were spectacular!  After many selfies, we walked (about 10min) up the stairway to Bonghwadae where we were almost blown away (literally, by the wind).  As there are no safety railings, and we were with young children, we did not get too adventurous and stayed near the stairway.After 1.5hr at Gwongeumseong Fortress, we explored Biseondae Rocks (2hr round trip).  I would imagine Biseondae Rocks to be breathtakingly beautiful in autumn.  In December (early winter), we could still see traces of the red leaves, though most trees were bare.  It was still a nice walk, as it was not as crowded and did not have the ""touristy"" feel of the cable car.  The trail was mostly flat, with a short upslope (rocky) path at the end.  Pretty manageable even for kids.There was not much time for a sit-down lunch after the walk.  We grabbed a few burgers at Lotteria instead.A lovely day trip.  Perhaps next time, I would plan to stay in Sokcho, so that I have more time to explore the lovely park."

Awesome The view on top of the mountain is out of this world. A bit windy on top but worth walking up. The whole park is so clean and so peaceful. One of my most favorite places to have seen. Definitely a place to see.
First visit from LA Great park to visit. We came here on off season which was great. Must do the cable ride to get up to the mountain. Huge Buddha in front of the temple. Beautiful time to visit would be in the fall for the vibrant colors of the trees.
Beautiful park This park is beautiful. Many well marked trails from both short and longer distances. Bus very convenient (7-1 from Sokcho- last stop). The bus accepted T Money as well as Cashbee cards so you won?™t need change if you have these cards. Payment for park entry 3500W is cash only. Stop in the visitor centre on arrival to get a trail map.
"amazing nature there The park is awesome with yellow and red leaves. It is highly recommended to make your efforts to the mountain trails which are quite easy to access. The way to the peak is beautiful, really beautiful i meant if you go in autumn.We went with the tour organized by kkkday and it was so smooth. It takes 3 hours from seoul to the park. While you can go there by public transport but it might be very hassle for bus changing. Take a local tour and it gets you right at the entrance, lunch box and tour guide is provided. The tour also includes tickets to cable car.Please note there are many spots in the park that you may choose which to go. Some guests prefer staying near the park the day before so that they can walk early in the morning. But for us a day trip in this park is totally fine.Great experience ever here!"
"A popular park among the locals Pros:  Beautiful woods, gorgeous autumnal colors, a variety of hikes available, entrance close to Sokcho, well-maintained trails, nice views, and interesting statues, etc. at the entrance.Cons:  Too crowded (but it was peak season for viewing the autumnal colors); guy at admissions told us the senior rates were just for the Koreans though everywhere else in Korea when we asked we were given senior rates (and there was no remark on the signs at the Park Entrance of the senior rates being applicable only to the locals); charge for parking,The pros easily outweigh the cons so don't miss Seoraksan National Park if you like to hike or take a walk."
Spring Korea Love this place so much ...A place with beautiful scenery ... lots of good photo spots there ... for Buddhist there is a big and happy Buddha statue with a temperature range of 6 sd. 10 Â° C in spring ...Should use light coat and simple shoes...
"Nature is amazing Nature is truly amazing. Visited the Seoraksan and hiked up to the Ulsan Peak -- took about 4 hours in total to hike up and down; during which you will also pass by the Sinheungsa temple and Ulsanbawi Rock. The route is not an easy hike as there're lots of stairs and rocky paths to climb up and down, but it is really worth it as you'll get rewarded with the magnificent view after reaching the peak.Getting to Seoraksan: Bus 7 or 7-1 from Sokcho Intercity/Express Bus Terminal The best Autumn feels It was worth it going up and riding the cable car. Love the autumn colored leaves around. although it was a bit crowded when we where there, it was still the best place to visit in Korea."
Amazing place Seoraksan national park is an amazing landscape with good trekking possibilities. The signalisation is perfect you can lose your way in this park.The best place to stay is in Sokcho just 20 min with bus every 10 min. So you can enjoy the mountain and the seaside. The Kensington Star Hotel I was is very poor. I can not recommend this Hotel. The restaurants in the park are good for finish a perfect day in the mountains.

Must see!
"A 2.5-hour ride from Seoul, Seoraksan is definitely one of the must-sees in Korea. We went here when autumn was about to turn the whole mountain into red but not quite yet so we had the opportunity to see varying shades of leaves. Take the cable car up and enjoy the breathtaking view!"
"Beautiful Autumn colours Beautiful scenery, breathing taking autumn colours ,Best hotel to stay for daily walks is Kensington Star Hotel Nice It takes a couple of hours drive to reach the place hence best option is a package tour and once there you can take a chair lift car ride or trek yourself to admire nature's wonders at close quarters .There are restaurants near the chair car  starting point for lunch etc .A great place to see  autumn leaves  as we saw in early November ."
"One of the most beautiful places in Korea The mountains in this area are stunning. The hike up Seoraksan is a long but very rewarding haul. If you make it to the top, there's a guy who will etch your name on a little medal for 10,000KRW."
"Beautiful views, hikes for all levels, canyons, and more This was a wonderful park to visit.  I did two hikes, The first to a waterfall.  That was a more moderate hike though it did involve stair climbing.  But for those who might need it, stopping to rest in a beautiful setting is not a bad thing.  The other was to the top of the mountain.  This is a much more advanced hike.  You pass through a slot canon on a catwalk above the river, up a steep incline, scramble over some rocks and visit multiple ecosystems.  Just doing walks through the boreal forest in the valley would be great.  I highly recommend this out of the way park."
"Spectacular in the Fall The park is busy in the fall but for a good reason ....the weather is magnificent (sunny and warm by day) and the colours are vivid and photogenic.  There is a cable car running up to the fortress rock.  Walks are very popular and many are easy although, as the paths rise, they become stoney with steps.  Steps all have good hand rails or ropes for support.Entrance is 3500 won and foreign seniors are excluded from the seniors admission which only applies to Koreans."
"Choose the right time and season Wear proper hike shoes, bring water and wear the right clothes for the season. There would be shops at the outer part of Seoraksan. Ulsanbawi course was easy to follow but I think the fact that our Airbnb host turned driver turned hike guide made it easy for us to find our way.We went hiking towards the end of autumn around Nov 18 of last year. We went for Ulsanbawi because it's one of the most popular ones and can be accessed from Sokcho. It was a short trail and before the actual ridge just around the Gyejoam Hermitage it was an easy hike even for beginners. I was expecting an amazing autumn foliage like the one at Naejangsan but since we hiked during the later part of November it was almost winter. Before we went to Seoraksan we stopped by the Descendants of the Sun film set or recreated film set at Taebek-si and the 38th Parallel East Coast. Our host just thought it would be nice to stop by the coast and it was really interesting and serene. There was one dude surfing in the cold autumn which was pretty amazing how he can stand the cold. We rented a car and a driver as it would be easier for us to maximize that day. If 4 of you will split the cost, it wouldn't be that bad. It was a cloudy day and since ""winter is coming"" Seoraksan felt a little gloomy. Trees and leaves wilted, the sky was grey and we were also tired with all the driving that day.We weren't able to make it to Ulsanbawi Ridge, we managed to get to the observatory and the temple but since it was getting dark and we have a long drive ahead, we decided to head back. The highlights of that trail were Tongil Daebul (The Great Unification Buddha) located in Sinheungsa Temple, observatory, the temples especially the Gyejoam hermitage and the boulder called Heundeulbawi close to it. There weren't that much hikers that time. What you read about Seorak being crowded might be true during the peak of Autumn.If I am going to come back and hike Seoraksan, I will do it at the early part of Autumn, I'll start in the morning and dedicate the whole day for us to have time to appreciate it and stop by the falls and actually get to the summit. I will still rent a car and bring friends who are hike enthusiasts as well."
Seorakson National Park waterfall hiking The distance for the hike is 2.1 km. It is at the peak that is so beautiful and scenic. At certain part of the hiking there were rocks and path narrow very scary. If you overcome it wow the scenery at the peak is wow. You completed it and you feel a sense of achievement.  It is best time to hide as the leaves change colour and so beautiful. It is real and not picture or photo.
Must visit point This place is really fantastic. Mt. Seorak in autumn shows the most beautiful foliage in the world. Entrance fee is 2500Won and you have to pay in cash. The cable car is 10000 won and you can pay the card.
"Beautiful view, worth the hike and climb."
"Fall is truly the best time of the year to visit this place and i cant agree more. I was amazed by the beautiful views and scenery of the mountain as soon as i got off the bus. The rocks are scary and steep, but it is all worth it once you see the beautiful scenery."
"Most Recent:Reviews ordered by most recent publish date in descending order.Detailed Reviews:Reviews ordered by recency and descriptiveness of user-identified themes such as wait time, length of visit, general tips, and location information."
"Beautiful Enchanting view. Trekked up to biryong falls. From Seoul, take the bus from express bus terminal. Tickets -w19700. 2 1/2- 3 hours ride with a rest stop inbetween for 15mins. Lots of accommodations at the foot of the mountain. Take bus no. 7-1, across from the Nambu bus terminal to reach destination. The last stop is at the entrance of the park.Ticket entry price is w3500."
"Autumn visit is special A lot of people looking for the beautiful autumn colours. Still plenty of other things to do like visiting the temple, Buddha statue, cable car trip and did a trekking trip. Went to the Biryong waterfall and a not too difficult trip. Did go up the staircase to the observatory; challenging but worth the sweat and effort - despite several efforts have not been able to find the altitude of the place."
"Seorak in autumn We're a little early for fall colors but the weather was very cooperative.  Mornings were clear and no rain, cool but not cold.  A bit cloudy in the pm otherwise perfect weather."
"Wish I came on late october To come here was the best decision you'll want to make when you come to Korea. I wish I come on late October to see the red leaves. We went there on early October, and have seen some of the trees were turning red. Since I hiked with my mom, we only reach Ulsanbawi top, but it's not that good I think, only rocks and temple. But the view from mountain feet is already good enough, maybe I have to hike up another peak to see different view."
Really beautiful park To visit during foliage. Many visitors will be there but the view is really wonderful and deserves a visit. Many paths for different level of difficulties.
"Great Autumn colors My family (with 5 and 6 yr olds) enjoyed the hike to Biryeong (2 hrs round trip) and the cable car ride to Gwongeumseong. These trail heads are close to the entrance to the national park. The Fall colors were wonderful and the temperature/humidity is just right.  There are several eateries/convenience stores in the park so don't worry about bringing your own lunch/snacks.  We were going to climb the Ulsanbawi the next day but decided not to after 1st day's hike (too difficult for my kids).  Instead we went to Biseondae, which is about the same difficulty as Biryeong Fall.  The trail map provided at the Visitors Center (located about 2 miles before the front gate) gives a pretty accurate estimates on difficulties and duration."
Nice place Nice place and landscape. Enjoyed hikibg there. However be aware that when it's crowded during holidays or high season it's really difficult to reach by car or by bus because of trafic. Same for the way back. But you need to see this if you're going to Sokcho Short bus ride to a nice park We took bus 7-1 from Sokcho into the park. Even with the rain we enjoyed a nice 2.4 km (one way) hike to see the waterfalls with a great suspension bridge along the way.
"Sogongwon-Daechongbong Peak-Osaek trail It is important to note that the said trail requires at least a good cardio and leg power to the climber, as well as the right hiking equipment. This trail can be considered already as a major climb.I stayed in a guesthouse near Jungang market, and from there, I rode a bus to Sogongwon (Bus 7-1; Bus 7 also goes to Sogongwon). Since the expected duration of the while climb was 10 hrs and 40 mins., I left at around 6AM. The entrance fee was KRW 3500, and upon validation of the ticket, they will give you a map. There's a lot of restaurants in Sogongwon, however, most were still closed, when I arrived. Luckily, there's this cafÃ© that was already open, serving sandwiches, juice and coffee.I started the trail at 7:10am, and the view is indeed spectacular, especially the foliage has already started in Mt. Seorak. The first half of the trail was generally easy/manageable, with lots of stairs. The view will take your tiredness away so no worries.Right after reaching Huiungak shelter, that is where the real deal begins. Gone were the beautiful views, as mostly you'll see rocks. It also started raining as I reached Socheong shelter. It was in the weather forecast, so I was prepared with my rainjacket, but I wasn't prepared with the continuous assault with nothing but rocks. It also started to get foggy. I reached Socheongbong peak with nothing to see but fog :(.I was hungry, cold and tired, as I reached Jungcheong shelter. I also had to replenish 1L of my water. I bought a warm can of coffee there as well. From inside, I saw nothing but fog outside. Thankfully, as I went outside, full and a bit rested, the fog suddenly cleared, the rainshower stopped. I was welcomed by a beautiful view! Just a few minutes more and I was able to reach the Daechongbong Peak (~1:50pm), took a picture and a quick rest before started my descent (~2:00pm).The descent to Osaek was a torture to the knees and legs, as it was all descent (I can't imagine going up there with straight ascent, without any views to distract your exhaustion). I reached the entrance of the park at 4:50pm, finishing the whole course in 9 hrs 40 mins.Contrary to the blogs I've read, there weren't much taxis when I got down. And there's actually a bus back! Around 1km from the entrance of Osaek, there's a bus terminal. The place looked like a convenience store, but there's a window inside where you can buy tickets. However, as I was to go back to Sokcho, the lady there told me that there's actually a bus that passes by! Osaek is in Yangyang, the town(?) next to Sokcho. I alighted the bus in Yangyang intercity bus terminal, and rode Bus 9, that goes to Sokcho. The disadvantage of riding the bus though, is that it took some time for it to arrive. I got down Mt. Seorak at 4:50pm, but the bus arrived at 6:40pm. The advantage was it was waaaay cheaper than riding a taxi."
"Generally we loved it We went to both Ulsanbawi and the cable car side.Ulsanbawi took longer time to go up as needed to walk and climb the staircases for 3.8 km from the entrance.The cable car station on the hill side was disappointed. the toilet was less maintained, dirty and extremely smelly considering the price you paid to go up there. You might think you are at a public toilet that need to climb up some kms up on the mountain. However, the view was nice. There was constructions on the way and caused the metal burning smell flying through to the 2nd floor scenery open air floor, very inconsiderable as the majorities of the visitors are families with little kids and babies."

"Very beautiful place Most people were there to hike but my family went to enjoy the scenery. Was bustling, I would recommend people to hike there instead of just visiting it. Even though there were some stores, there was a limited variety of souvenirs/food. Really very beautiful place!"
Great day out We did the cable car and walked a bit on the top.It's probably the best thing to do at the national park if you're short of time. We only had the entire morning and hence decided on doing this. It was very well worth it. The crowd control was seamless and the trek at the top is very doable. We had 2 elderly people with us and they thoroughly enjoyed it. Of course there are a lot of trekking routes at the park but the day we went it was sweltering hot and the waterfall trek we intended on doing was advised against due to the lack of flow along the waterfall.
"Beautiful but steep steps to the waterfalls Beautiful hike to the waterfalls but the hike itself was hard. It's for fit people. Especially, the stairs to the viewing platform."
"Yongso Falls Hiking Course Seoraksan National Park is a large area, about 398.2km2 and spread to 4 cities. Many hiking trails in this park. Yongso waterfall hiking course(1hr, 3.2km) is one of the easiest and shortest, but it has scenic advantage. Usually people trek this course from Yaksuteo Hiking Support Center (?½ìˆ˜?°íƒë°©ì??ì„¼?? ??Seongguksa Temple (?±êµ­?? ??Yongso Waterfall (?©ì†Œ??¬) ??Yongso Waterfall Hiking Support Center (?©ì†Œ??¬?ë°©ì§€?ì„¼??, it is going upstream, so you will have a slope a little bit.(Category of difficulty is grade C).In early of September 2017 we went together with our in-laws and relatives, the other way around. We were dropped off at Yongso Waterfall Support Center and the driver will pick up us at Yaksuteo HSC. Because of we walked downstream, the slope was very little, easier.The trek was in Jujeon valley, it was not difficult trek, some part has wooden bridge covered with rubber tires to prevent slippery and also suspension bridge. Mostly the trek was on riverside. The scenery was amazing. Yongso waterfall was a 6 meters high, the debit of the river was minimum, a lot of rocks in the river, some little fishes  in some part of the river. The sceneries  were green every where, the color of late summer. Autumn's color had not yet seen. Seongguksa Temple was located after we walked 2/3 length of the trail. there was fountain in front of the temple, the water has medicinal effects, we stopped a while and continued until Yaksuteo HSC and Osaek Mineral Spring (?¤ìƒ‰?½ìˆ˜??. Along the 200-300m road here; there were Korean restaurants, and some stalls selling roots, and wild mushroom. Then we stop at Osaek bus stop that has flowing pool of mineral water. So we could rest our feet in this warm mineral water. We also had our lunch served in Korean bento here. Toilet facility was around parking area. Nice trek, nice scenery. Good facility."
"Very popular with local people, for a good reason!"
"Absolutely fantastic this place! Something to do for everyone.... Buddhist monasteries, restaurants, cable car, short walk to waterfalls, etc.... And best of all, serious hiking on many routes, all very well maintained. Watching the sunrise from the summit is sooooo impressive and unforgettable."
"Beautiful National Park Seoraksan National Park is a very beautiful place to walk or hike around. so many things to see at the national park, Many trails for you to hike and ride the cable car to the mountain. Amazing view at Seoraksan National Park."
"Nice View you need to wear a appropriate attire here. its basically, literally hiking. you can ride the cable car and see the amazing view already. but if you want even better view, go up more and see ur self. its worth it. also they have a temple down there, so beautiful."
"Beautiful View Drove to Seoraksan from Seoul with my parents. Make sure you're equipped with a good GPS. Went in July 2017 - hot days and heavy rains!If you're heading for the Buddha and the cable car - use the cable car location on your GPS. Some of the road signs once you get close to Seoraksan divert you to the hiking trails etc.Took us about 4 hours from Seoul. A few restaurants before you get to Seoraksan National Park entrance, but a few more cafes once you get into the park.Got the cable car up, and unfortunately we only got a brief view of the surrounds due to thick cloud. There's a small cafe up the mountain serving waffles and ice cream. If you're equipped with good walking shoes, there are a few paths you could walk along once you get to the top.Back down - nice paths and walks to the Unification Buddha, and very peaceful stream running alongside.Would be ideal for a hike."
"so little time, so much to do!"
"My itinerary was set to 2N3D to explore Sokcho inlcuding Seoraksan National Park. Sokcho alone (excluding Seoraksan) already has a lot to offer. But this place is HUUUUGE! There is a lot to do here! I definitely need to go back and plan a longer trip, perhaps an entire week to equally enjoy explore and rest.Goes without saying: wear comfortable clothes: rubber shoes / outdoor sandals, a light jacket (I went end-August), and lots of drinking water.There's an activity for everyone. Different peaks to climb up to, depending on your level of stamina, energy and will-power!"
A must go place!
A must go place in the area. The actual main reason of going to Sokcho. Good place for hiking but also a good place to enjoy for a short time by using the cable car. The view never lets you down and the fancy cafes near the entrance are worth visiting and will give you a different scenery of the park.

"Wonderful national Parc We had a delightful moment trekking around the parc and visiting the different temples and rivers.Unfortunately, the rain stopped us 1.8km from the top.Who knows, better luck tomorrow?You have need to come."
"Nice visit in inclement weather We visited Mount Seorak as part of a tour and even though the weather was on and off rain, it was still enjoyable! We saw the reunification Buddha and is it big! There was also Shinheungsa Temple which was interesting and then caught the cable car to the top. It was a good ride and once at the top a short walk will take you to the very top! I can imagine the view would be amazing but there was a lot of fog on the day and next to zero visibility ! Still worth it, if you're in the area stop and look!"
One of my favorite places in South Korea The park is beatiful and big - lots of routes to choose from. There's also a cable car going to one of the mountains. Wonderful nature and view of the surrounding mountains and you can also see the ocean from up there!Close to the centre of Sokcho with good bus connections.Would love to come back during autumn or when the temperatures are not so high.
"Fantastic Park with a wide variety of hikes This national park is easy accessible from Sokcho. Take bus 7 or 7-1 and it will bring you to the entrance.The park has a lot of highlights and hikes towards it. These hikes vary in difficulty and length.We went to Ulsanbawi Rock, which has a great view over the rocky area and the city of Sokcho all the way to the sea.The first part is very easy, the road is not steep. Then you will reach the stone and wooden stairs and you will have to climb for more than 1km. This is a hard part,but really worth it.The return hike is 4 hours in total.Enjoy!"
Stunning.
"Absolutely stunning views.Very easy to access by public transport.Loads of trek courses to choose, with clear signage and information to make your choice.Fill up your water bottle at the tourist information centre, or have your lunch at the many food stores( quite reasonably priced) before your trek.There are clean toilets along the trek too."
"Lots of hiking options.  Highly recommended Loved this National park!  Take bus 7 or 7-1 from Sokcho bus station which gets you to the main entrance.  They run about every fifteen minutes. We hiked here for three days and could have happily done another.There is a fantastic coffee place that roasts onsite.  Go past the big Buddha, before the temple.  It is across a little bridge, in a traditional looking house.  Great single origin, and yummy blueberry smoothies!  Also serve homemade scones and a few biscuits.  Set up for snacks, but not meals.There are a variety of restaurants before the big Buddha.  No convenience store, so bring your hiking snacks with you.  But easy to have lunch here.  Veggo options were bibimbap, potato pancake or spring onion (without the seafood).  There was also a burger place, and a pizza place.Also an international ATM just outside the park gates, which we used.  Don't choose the ""English"" option.  Choose ""foreign card"". Then it works a treat! Up to 300,000 won withdrawals.There is a cable car here, if thats your thing.The various more serious hiking routes have cut off times noted on the trail map.  You must reach certain markers by that time in order to continue up.  If you are too late, you will not be permitted to continue.  So get an early start if you are tackling one of the longer routes."
My favorite place in Korea!
Seoraksan national park is by far my favorite place to visit in Korea.  It has many trails for all levels.  Even a visit to the main plaza is worth a visit!
Nice & charming Visited this place once in winter many years ago & this time in summer. It provides a totally different view and feel to it. Moreover since it's de low season we could take our time to snap all the photos we want.It requires a bit of hiking but it's not taxing at all. We went up the temple trail & passed by the great Buddha. The temple is 1400 years old! How amazing is that.There's another trail up the cable car way but we didn't take the cable car as it's closed today due to strong winds.
"Great Scenic Spots for Nature Very peaceful place. I highly recommend going to this place. There's a cable car going up the mountain. Great views at the top. We also hiked the mountain top. Kinda slippery because of the melted snow. If you want to hike to the top, use shoes that are not slippery and durable enough."
Beautiful scenery.
We hiked the Seoraksan Mountain and it gave us an awe view from the top of the mountain. You can choose to hike from below or to take the cable car up. It's really windy up there so I wouldn't personally advise anyone to bring their hats/caps along. And girls with skirts are less preferable as we've seen a lot of girls wearing skirts having their skirts up to their face. It's fun to hike during spring as it's not too hot nor too cold and you can enjoy the beautiful flowers and nature around. There's a lot of restaurants down at the park so you won't worry having to starve yourself.

Great scenery Really nice hike. We did ulsanbawi which was about 4 hours in total up and down. There are buses while go from the city to the national park every 10 minutes. Definitely recommend this place.
"wonderful mountain.. must visit beautiful nature, highly recommend this place.but sadly when i hiked the ulsanbawi, the view blocked by the heavy fog.but still nice and enjoyable hike Beautiful nature, fun experience staying at a shelter We (4 friends, 25 y/o) did a 2 day hike in Seoraksan Park and made it to the highest peak. Nature is outstanding: clear water streams, beautiful mountains, amazing sunrise around 5am. It was a very safe hike, there were quite a lot of stairs, handrails, and signs. Downside is that you feel a bit less connected with nature. The views were great though. We hiked during the week and met quite a few other hikers, heard it gets crowded during weekends.* Since there are so many signs, you could easily hike here by yourself.We stayed at a shelter, book this in advance on the Seoraksan website! The reservation process is quite simple. Bring your own cooking utensils and food, as the shelter is super basic. Sleeping in the shelter was a great experience and we met some very friendly Koreans."
Very scenic This park is really stunning.  It is so green now in late May.  The giant Buddha statue is great.  Many people are hiking.  Take a ride on the cable car.  Stop and have lunch (the margherita pizza was great!).  There's a nice gift shop by the cable car with beautiful amethyst jewelry made from Korean amethyst.
"Majestic Mountain It takes 40 minutes by bus 7-1 from downtown Sokcho to the park (1,200 Won).  The entrance fee is 3,500 Won.  The cable car is near the entrance (10,000 Won).  It is every 5 min.  You may have to wait one hour to board.  Meanwhile you can go to see the nearby buddha statue in the Sinheungsa Temple.  At the top cable car station you can follow a trail up a huge rocky area where many people are.  The scenery is majestic.  You can also follow a trail down to Anlakam Hermitage where you can try to find an 800-year-old pine.  You then go back to the top cable car station and ride down.  Unfortunately we did not have time to hike other trails.  Next time."
"Wow! Truly wonderful We spent the day wandering through the woods and exploring the Buddhist temple.There is an admission charge for the park and an additional fee to ride the cable car up and down the mountain.There were many places to eat or bring your lunch. We got there early in the morning and beat the insane rush of people into the park, so go early."
"Worthy a visit We arrived at the Express Bus Terminal Station and boarded a bus headed for Sokcho. Had bought the tickets earlier to avoid disappointment as we had only a few days to spend in Seoul. You will be allocated a seat number on the bus which is clean, spacious and comfortable.Be prepared that it is a 3hour bus ride with a 15min rest stop miway.Upon arrival at the Sokcho express bus terminal, we switched to a local bus number 7 or 7-1 to arrive at the entrance to the Seroraksan Natonal Park.Please remember to head to the cable car station to buy tickets if you want an aerial view at the top. Since we went on a weekday, it was a breeze as we didn't wait long for our ride up to the top.After exiting the cable car, we made our way up the meadering pathway filled with steps and uneven surface that led to the peak. Make sure to wear comfortable and non-slip shoes to walk on the rockground. Upon reaching the peak, you will have a beautiful view of Sokcho from the top. There were also lots of rocks formations that are picture-perfect.When we got back down to the cable car station, we walked around the park area with the famous Buddha statue and the surrounding temple architure that surrounds the place.We were afraid that a day trip might be too rush since it's a 3hr to and fro bus ride but surprisingly, we even managed to squeeze in time for the Sokcho Fishery Market where we had a sumptous lunch of seafood cooked on the spot before returning to Seoul.Good attraction to visit in your visit to South Korea."
Great day out.
"One of our highlights on our travels round South Korea. Great hiking , brilliant views from the cable car. Good food available on site. Easy to get to from Andong by local bus."
"Mountains beyond mountains It's almost impossible to run out of things to do here, as there are numerous different routes. There are waterfalls, caves and huge standing rocks to see. And for those not inclined towards hiking there is a cablecar up to a viewing area on one of the mountains.The park costs ï¿?500 to enter, and thr cable car a further ï¿?0,000. Be advised the cable car does not operate of there are strong winds, and the mountains are closed during some parts of the year, so try and find information before you go hiking."
"Wonderful Scenery We visited Seoraksan National Park in mid April, coming by car from Seoul. The place, the temple and the mountain are gorgeous, particularly in the spring with many many trees in flower. The main attraction is a cable car that goes up the mountain, leaving every 10 minutes, and very fast. From there the view is exceptional and marvelous. On top there are some observation decks and it is also possible to walk around the area with many different prospectives to see the nature.Back in the park we went to see a beautiful temple and a big Buddha statue, all  interesting. There are several places to walk around and also cafes and restaurants. There are also hotels in the park. We only spend a day but you can also stay longer because there are many places to visit and outdoor activities to do."

Wonderful!
This is very nice national park. We were lucky with sunny weather so we could see North Korea from here.
Well worth the trip Highly recommended if you like nature. You don't have to hike- just look! Fantastic views. Try the cable car.
"A great place to visit but get there early WE were up early and out trekking before 8am and there was no one around what a great time we had and the National park is fantastic well worth a visit whilst here. do get there early as the day trips come in thick and fast as soon as the cable car opens Serenity and Scenery A drive up the valley to the Park, the usual slow crawl to the Parking lot, go early!  A walk around the Buddhist temples, there's a temple-stay feature.  Well made paved paths straddle the manicured flood plain stream.  A cable car whisks folks up one side for a high view, the Ulsanbawi Trail is a but of legwork. Partway up is the Heundalbawi Rock photo op and rock cave temple.  Oh and the Big Buddha.  All in all a long full day, Korean National Parks has brought the outdoors to the masses."
Shinheungsa temple When i came there cable car not operated because a strong wind.i only go to shinheungsa temple.it's a good temple and easy to get there.you can make donation on its.you can go inside big budha from back side.and there place to pray but not camera allowed Nice view Very nice view from up there.

A rocky mountain we goint to one of the top using cable car and a 10 minutes walk uphill.. A very beautiful spot for photography..
"Beautiful Stunning national park with excellent facilities (plentiful clean public toilets), great well planned and maintained paths and very easy to access. Get bus 7 or 7-1 from Sokcho town centre."
"Unbelievable beauty We really enjoyed our day exploring Mt Seorak. The park was not very busy and we easily caught a ride on the cable car and then hiked to the peak. We also enjoyed seeing the giant Buddha and the temple. Several in our party hiked to the waterfall and back and loved it. However, we did have our parents with us and it would have been to hard on their knees to make the steep climb and all of those stairs but the teens loved it!"
"Snow on top of the mountain Coming from a equator country, there were snow/ice at the foot of the mountain which was cooling and nice feeling for us. When we reached the top cable car station, we could see white snow all around. we hiked up the trail following our tour guide to the top part of the mountain. Real cold experience but nice. Had the time of my life playing with the snow all around. Even though spring is approaching, the weather is still 1 deg C or lower at top of the mountain. The top cable car station has a cafeteria that serves delicious hot chocolate drink there.(Very good for the cold weather). Nice to sit around the benches at the cable car station and enjoy the view around."

Great hikes This was my favorite part of my days in South Korea. There are so many hiking trails with amazing views. We had great weather. A must!
Great nature experience We were lucky to have such great sunny days for hiking. In april there were not that many people. The cherry blossoms were blooming and mild wind was lovely. Wonderful place to visit in Korea and it's only couple of hours from Seoul.
"Meet up with nature Since our time in korea limited, we planned to visit sokcho to go to seorakshan.From seoul we went by express bus, bus fare around W18.100. Takes 3 hours to get there.From express bus terminal in sokcho, walk across the street to the bus stop. Take bus no 7 or 7-1 and in the end of the journey, you will arrive at the gate of seoraksan national park.The place is so big, you can enjoy it with cable car or beat the tracks. It's my second time went there. The first time the weather so cloudy and wind blows quite hard so the cable car closed.If we walk along the tracks we will find big Budha statue, stone bridge and temple in the end of the path.This time, the cable car was open, so we tried different way. After buy the ticket, we wait for a sec, and when the cable car arrive, we all went inside. About 30 people can be in one cable car and take around 7 min. The view from cable car is breathtaking. We can see the national park from above, the sea, the mountain.After arrive at the cable car station, we walk to the peak of the mountain. It's a little rain when we begin to climb. The path is clear and safe. In the end of it, there's a large area for you to enjoy the scenery. We still meet snow, the mountain is cover with snow.After take some picture, we went back to the cable car station to warm ourself.If you got hungry, they sell snack there, toppoki, pancake, grill sausage. And you also can enjoy the nature there."
Amazing if you have good weather It is si beatifull park of course if the weather is good.you can take easy and moderate or hard trails.very good informatione centre are the right after the park gate.for me number one-Ulsanbawi Rock and second Cable Car.
"Great view Really enjoy the cable car.  After that you have to go up stairs around 10minutes, but it's really worth it to go there because the view is really amazing. If you dont't want to go up, you can stay in cablecar stop, there is a cafe so you can enjoy some snack there Snow and cable car...wooohooo There is still snow at the top. After a cable car ride...and the ride is quite fast ,step out and my whole family is so excited to found out that there are a lot of snow out there. The view from the top is magnificent and don't forget to try the cheese pretzel at the local bar...its delicious."
"Words can't describe This mountain was absolutely breathtaking. It was everything they said and more.The first day I started around 430am at the main entrance (sogongwon I think). I was planning to head to Daechongbong peak through Cheonbuldong valley and from there head back through the dragon ridge which is supposedly more difficult than Cheonbuldong.Everything was going smoothly but it was 6am, I was already at Bisondae rock and the sun hadn't risen still. Since the internet told me the climb would be much steeper. At this point I decided to wait and lost about 30 minutes just doing nothing.I reached Daechongbong past noon and since it was autumn, I decided not to risk heading back through dragon ridge since nightfall would come early. Instead, I took the route to the nearest exit. The name is Osaek springs I think.It was so enchanting. I think it was partially because I started the climb before dawn and on a Monday. So I barely saw any people until I hit Yangpok shelter. I climbed on October. So when I started the climb my surroundings were that of Autumn. When I gained elevation it became fall. And lastly, near the peak I felt the Korean winter.This place is so special to me and always will be since this was probably my last trip to Korea. I'm glad it ended with a bang."
"Fabulous Mountains Temple and Walks Really worth the 2.5hr bus trip from Seoul. Try the cable car on a clear day. Great little cafÃ© roaster on site. Lots of eateries. The temple complex is living Buddhism and has a temple stay. Entry fee is 3,500 and car parking 4,000. We bussed in on No7 - very frequent from Sokcho town."
"Spectacular Views We enjoyed the cable car ride to the ancient mountain top fortress and there was spectacular views (the best scenery that we saw in South Korea), particularly with the snow/ice covered peaks. We started the walk to Ulsanbawi but due to the season (early sunset), we turned back before we got there. There were lots of places to catch the bus that travels to the National Park, so have a look at the route on Google Maps before committing yourself to travelling back to the bus terminal. We stayed in Sokcho for two nights, so as not to have to travel too much in one day but we would recommend shortening the time you spend in Sokcho, where possible. We didn't find too much else to do in the town."
